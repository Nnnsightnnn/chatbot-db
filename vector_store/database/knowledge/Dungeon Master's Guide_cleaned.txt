INTRODUCTION

r

T 'S GOOD TO BE  THE DU NGEON MASTER!  NOT ONLY

d? y~u get to tell fantastic stories about heroes,

v1llams, monsters, and magic, but you also get

to create the world in which these stories live.

Whether you're running a D&D game already

or you think it's something you want to  try, this

book is for you.

The Dungeon Master's Guide assumes that you know

the basics of how to play the D&D tabletop roleplaying

game. If you haven't played before, the DuNGEONS f!f>

DRAGONS Starter Set is a great starting point for new

players and DMs.

This book has two important companions: the Player's

Handbook, which contains the rules your players need

to  create characters and the rules you need to  run the

game, and the Monster Manual, which contains ready-to

use monsters to populate your D&D world.

THE DUNGEON MASTER

The Dungeon Master (DM) is the creative force

behind a D&D game. The DM creates a world for the

other players to explore, and also creates and runs

adventures that drive the story. An adventure typically

hinges on the successful completion of a quest, and

can be as short as a single game session. Longer

adventures might embroil players in great conflicts that

require multiple game sessions to resolve. When strung

together, these adventures form an ongoing campaign.

A D&D campaign can include dozens of adventures and

last for months or years.

A Dungeon Master gets to wear many hats. As the

architect of a campaign , the DM creates adventures

by placing monsters, traps, and treasures for the other

players' characters (the adventurers) to discover. As

a storyteller, the DM helps the other players visualize

what's happening around them, improvising when the

adventurers do something or go somewhere unexpected.

As an actor, the DM plays the roles of the monsters and

supporting characters, breathing life into them. And as a

referee, the DM interprets the rules and decides when to

abide by them and when to change them.

Inventing, writing, storytelling, improvising, acting,

refereeing-every DM handles these roles differently,

and you'll probably enjoy some more than others. It

helps to remember that DUNGEONS  & DRAGONS  is a

hobby,  and being the DM should be fun.  Focus .on the

aspects you enjoy and downplay the rest. For example, if

you don't like creating your own adventures, you can use

published ones. You  can also lean on the other players

to help you with rules mastery and world-building.

The D&D rules help you and the other players have

a good time, but the rules aren't in charge. You're the

DM,  and you are in charge of the game. That said , your

goal isn't to slaughter the adventurers but to create a

campaign world that revolves around their actions and

decisions, and to keep your players coming back for

more! If you're lucky, the events of your campaign will

echo in the memories of your players long after the final

game session is concluded.

How TO UsE THIS BooK

This  book is orga nized in three parts. The first part

helps you  decide what kind of campaign you'd like to

run. The s econd part helps you create the adventures

the stor ies-that will compose the campaign and

keep the players  entertained from one game session

to the next. The last part helps you adjudicate the

rules of the game and modify them to suit the style of

your campa ign.

PART 1:  MASTER OF WORLDS

Every DM is the creator of his or her own campaign

world. Whether you invent a world, adapt a world from

a favorite movie or novel, or use a published setting for

the D&D game, you make that world your own over the

course of a campaign.

The world where you set your campaign is one of

countless worlds that make up the D&D multiverse,

a vast array of planes and worlds where adventures

happen. Even if you're using an established world such

as the Forgotten Realms, your campaign takes place

in a sort of mirror universe of the official setting where

Forgotten Realms novels, game products, and digital

games are assumed to take place. The world is yours to

change as you see fit  and yours to modify as you explore

the consequences of the players' actions.

Your world is more than just a backdrop for

adventures. Like Middle Earth, Westeros, and countless

other fantasy worlds out there, it's a place to which you

can escape and witness fantastic stories unfold. A well

designed and well-run world seems to flow around the

adventurers, so that they feel  part of something, instead

of apart from it.

Consistency is a key to a believable fictional

world. When the adventurers go  back into town for

supplies, they should encounter the same nonplayer

characters.(NPCs) they met before. Soon, they'll  learn

the barkeep's name, and he or she will remember

theirs as well. Once you have achieved this degree of

consistency, you can provide an occasional change. If

the adventurers come back to  buy more horses at the

stables, they might discover that the man who ran the

place went back home to the large city over the hills,

and now his niece runs the family business. That sort of 

change- one that has nothing to do with the adventurers

directly, but one that they'll notice- makes the players

feel  as though their characters are part of a living world

that changes  and grows along with them.

Part 1 of this book is all about inventing your world.

Chapter 1 asks what type of game you want to  run, and

helps you nail down a few important details about your

world and its overarching conflicts. Chapter 2 helps you

put your world in the greater context of the multiverse,

expanding on the information presented in the Player's

Handbook to discuss  the planes of existence and the

gods and how you can put them together to serve the

needs of your campaign.

PART 2:  MASTER  OF ADVENTURES

Whether you write your own adventures or use

published ones, expect to invest preparation time

beyond the hours you spend at the gaming table. You'll

need to carve out some free time to exercise your

creativity as you invent compelling plots, create new

NPCs, craft encounters, and think of clever ways to

foreshadow story events yet to come.

Part 2 of this book is devoted to helping you create

and run great adventures. Chapter 3 covers the basic

elements of a D&D adventure, and chapter 4 helps you

create memorable NPCs. Chapter 5 presents guidelines

and advice for running adventures set in dungeons,

the wilderness, and other locales, and chapter 6 covers

the time between adventures. Chapter 7 is all about

treasure, magic items, and special rewards that help

keep the players invested in your campaign.

PART  3:  MASTER  OF  RULES

DUNGEONS  & DRAGONS  isn't a head-to-head competition,

but it needs someone who is impartial yet involved in the

game to guarantee that everyone at the table plays by the

rules. As the player who creates the game world and the

adventures that take place within it,  the DM is a natural



fit  to take on the referee role.

As a referee, the DM acts as a mediator between the

rules and the players. A player tells the DM what he or

she wants to do,  and the DM determines whether it is

successful or not, in some cases asking the player to

make a die roll to determine success. For example, if a

player wants his or her character to take a swing at an

ore, you say, "Make an attack roll" while looking up the

ore's Armor Class.

The rules don't account for every possible situation

that might arise during a typical D&D session. For

example, a player might want his or her character to

hurl a brazier full of hot coals into a monster's face.

How you determine the outcome of this action is up to

you. You  might tell the player to make a Strength check,

while mentally setting the Difficulty Class (DC) at 15.

If the Strength check is successful, you then determine

how a face full of hot coals affects the monster. You

might decide that it deals ld4 fire damage and imposes

disadvantage on the monster's attack rolls until the end

of its next turn. You  roll the damage die (or let the player

do it),  and the game continues.

Sometimes mediating the rules means setting limits.

If a player tells you, "I want to run up and attack the

ore," but the character doesn't have enough movement

to reach the ore, you say, "It's  too far away to move up

and still attack. What would you like to do instead?"

The player takes the information and comes up with a

different plan.

To referee the rules, you need to know them. You  don't

have to memorize this book or the Player's Handbook,

but you should have a clear idea of their contents so that,

when a situation requires a ruling, you know where to

find the proper reference.

The Player's Handbook contains the main rules you

need to play the game. Part 3 of this book offers a wealth

of information to  help you adjudicate the rules in a wide

variety of situations. Chapter 8 presents advice for using

attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. It also

includes options appropriate for certain play styles and

campaigns, including guidelines for using miniatures,

a system for handling chase scenes, and rules for

madness. If you like to create your own stuff, such

as new monsters, races, and character backgrounds,

chapter 9 shows you how. That chapter also contains

optional rules for unusual situations or play styles, such

as the use of firearms in a fantasy setting.

INTRODUCTION

letting them find  things when they take the time

to explore.

providing rich descriptions of exciting environments,

and using interesting maps and props.

giving monsters secrets to uncover or cultural

INSTIGATING

Player's who like to instigate action are eager to make

things happen, even if that means taking perilqus risks.

They would rather rush headlong into danger and face

the consequences than face boredom.

Engage players who like to instigate by ...

allowing them to affect their surroundings.

including things in your adventures to tempt them.

letting their actions put the characters in a tight spot.

including encounters with NPCs who are as feisty and

unpredictable as they are.

INTRODUCTTON

PART1

Master of Worlds







OUR WORLD IS TH E SETTING  FOR YOUR CAMPAIGN ,

the place where adventures happen. Even

if you use an existing setting, such as the

Forgotten Realms, it becomes yours as you

set your adventures there, create characters

to  inhabit it, and make changes to it over

the course of your campaign. This chapter is all about

building your world and then creating a campaign to

take place in it.

THE  BIG PICTURE

This book, the Player's Handbook, and the Monster

Manual present the default assumptions for how the

worlds of D&D work. Among the established settings of

D&D, the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance,

and Mystara don't stray very far from  those

assumptions. Settings such as Dark Sun, Eberron,

Raven loft, Spelljammer, and Planescape venture further

away from that baseline. As you create your own world,

it's up to you to  decide where on the spectrum you want

your world to  fall.

CoRE AssuMPTIONS ______ _

The rules of the game are based on the following core

assumptions about the game world.

Gods Oversee the World. The gods are real and

embody a variety of beliefs, with each god claiming

dominion over an aspect of the world, such as war,

forests, or the sea. Gods exert influence over the world

by granting divine magic to their followers and sending

signs and portents to guide them. The follower of a god

serves as an agent of that god in the world . The agent

seeks to further the ideals of that god and defeat its

rivals. While some folk might refuse to honor the gods,

none can deny their existence.

Much of the World Is Untamed.  Wild regions

abound. City-states, confederacies, and kingdoms

of various sizes dot the Ia ndscape, but beyond their

borders the wilds crowd in. People know the area they

live in well. They've heard stories of other places from

merchants and travelers, but few know what lies beyond

the mountains or in the depths of the great forest unless

they've  been there themselves.

The  World Is Ancient. Empires rise and fall , leaving

few places that have not been touched by imperial

grandeur or decay. War,  time, and natural forces

eventually claim the mortal world, leaving it rich with

places of adventure and mystery. Ancient civilizations

and their knowledge survive in legends, magic

items, and their ruins. Chaos and evil often follow an

empire's collapse.

Conflict Shapes the World's History. Powerful

individuals strive to make their mark on the world, and

factions of like-minded individuals can alter the course

of history. Factions include religions led by charismatic

prophets, kingdoms ruled by lasting dynasties, and

shadowy societies that seek to master long-lost magic.

The influence of such factions waxes and wanes as

they compete with each other for power. Some seek to

preserve the world and usher in a golden age. Others

strive toward evil ends, seeking to  rule the world with

an iron fist.  Still others seek goals that range from

the practical to the esoteric, such as the accumulation

of material wealth or the resurrection of a dead god.

Whatever their goals, these factions inevitably collide,

creating conflict that can steer the world's fate.

The World Is Magical.  Practitioners of magic are

relatively few in number, but they leave evidence of

their craft everywhere. The magic can be as innocuous

and commonplace as a  potion that heals wounds to

something much more rare and impressive, such as a

levitating tower or a stone golem guarding the gates

of a city. Beyond the realms of civilization are caches

of magic items guarded by magic traps, as well as

magically constructed dungeons inhabited by monsters

created by magic, cursed by magic, or endowed with

magical abilities.

IT's YouR WoRLD _______  _

In creating your campaign world, it helps to start with

the core assumptions and consider how your setting

might change them. The subsequent sections of this

chapter address each element and give details on how to

flesh out your world with gods, factions,  and so forth.

The assumptions sketched out above aren't carved

in stone. They inspire exciting D&D worlds full of

adventure, but they're not the on ly set of assumptions

that can do so. You can build an interesting campaign

concept by altering one or more of those core

assumptions, just as well-established D&D worlds have

done. Ask yourself, "What if the standard assumptions

weren't true in my world?"

The World Is a Mundane Place. What if magic is rare

and dangerous, and even adventurers have limited or no

access to  it? What if your campaign is set in a version of

our own world's history?

The  World Is New. What if your world is new, and

the characters are the first of a long line of heroes?

The adventurers might be champions of the first

great empires, such as the empires of Netheril and

Cormanthor in the Forgotten Realms setting.

The World Is Known. What if the world is completely

charted and mapped, right down to the "Here there be

dragons" notations? What if great empires cover huge

stretches of countryside, with clearly defined borders

between them? The Five Nations of the Eberron setting

were once part of a great empire, and magically aided

travel between its cities is commonplace.

Monsters Are Uncommo"n.  What if monsters are

rare and terrifying? In the Ravenloft setting, horrific

domains are governed by monstrous rulers. The

populace lives in perpetual terror of these darklords

and their evil  minions, but other monsters rarely trouble

people's daily lives.

Magic Is Everywhere. What if every town is ruled

by a powerful wizard? What if magic item shops are

common? The Eberron setting makes the use of magic

an everyday occurrence, as magical flying ships and

trains carry travelers from one great city to another.

Gods Inhabit the Land, or Are Entirely Absent.

What if the gods regularly walk the earth? What if the

characters can challenge them and seize their power?

Or what if the gods are remote, and even angels never

make contact with mortals? In the Dark Sun setting, the

gods are extremely distant-perhaps nonexistent-and

clerics rely instead on elemental power for  their magic.

Gons OF YouR WoRLD

Appendix B of the Player's Handbook presents a

number of pantheons (loose groupings of deities not

united by a single doctrine or philosophy) for  use in your

game, including the gods of established D&D worlds

and fantasy-historical pantheons. You can adopt one of

these pantheons for your campaign, or pick and choose

deities and ideas from them as you please. See "A

Sample Pantheon" in this section for an example.

As far as the game's rules are concerned, it doesn't

matter if your world has hundreds of deities or a church

devoted to a single god. In rules terms, clerics choose

domains, not deities, so your world can associate

domains with deities in any way you choose.

LOOSE  PANTHEONS

Most D&D worlds have a loose pantheon of gods.

A multitude of deities rule the various aspects of

existence, variously cooperating with and competing

against one another to administer the affairs of the

universe. People gather in public shrines to worship

gods of life and wisdom, or meet in hidden places to

venerate gods of deception or destruction.

Each deity in a pantheon has a portfolio and is

responsible for advancing that portfolio. In the

Greyhawk setting, Heironeous is a god of valor who

calls clerics and paladins to  his service and encourages

them to spread the ideals of honorable warfare,

chival ry,  and justice in society. Even in the midst of his

everlasting war with his brother Hextor, god of war and

tyra nny, Heironeous promotes his own portfolio: war

fought nobly and in the cause of justice.

People in most D&D worlds are polytheistic, honoring

deities of their own and acknowledging pantheons of

other cultures. Individuals pay homage to various gods,

regardless of alignment. In the Forgotten Realms, a

person might propitiate Umberlee before setting out

to sea, join a communal feast to celebrate Chauntea at

harvest time, and pray to Malar before going hunting.

Some individuals feel a calling to a particular deity's

service and claim that god as a patron. Particularly

devoted individuals become priests by setting up a

shrine or helping to staff a holy site. Much more rarely,

those who feel  such a calling become clerics or paladins

invested with the responsibility of true divine power.

Shrines and temples serve as community gathering

points for  religious rites and festivals. Priests at such

sites relate stories of the gods, teach the ethics of their

patron deities, offer advice and blessings, perform

religious rites, and provide training in activities their

deities favor.  Cities and large towns can host several

temples dedicated to individual gods important to the

community, while smaller settlements might have a

single shrine devoted to any gods the locals revere.

To quickly build a pantheon for your world, crea~e

a single god for each of the eight domains available

to clerics: Death, Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature,

Tempest, Trickery, and War. You can invent names

and personalities for  these deities, or borrow deities

from other pantheons. This approach gives you a small

pantheon that covers the most significant aspects of

existence, and it's easy enough to extrapolate other

areas of life each deity controls. The god of Knowledge,

and the god of time.

A  SAMPLE  PANTHEO N

The pantheon of the Dawn War is an example of a

pantheon assembled from mostly preexisting elements

to suit the needs of a particular campaign. This is

the default pantheon in the fourth edition Player's

Handbook (2008). The pantheon is summarized in the

Dawn War Deities table.

This pantheon draws in several nonhuman deities

and establishes them as universal gods. These gods

include Bahamut, Corellon, Gruumsh, Lolth, Moradin,

Sehanine, and Tiamat. Humans worship Moradin and

Corell on as gods of their respective portfolios, rather

than as racial deities. The pantheon also includes the

archdevil Asmodeus as god of domination and tyranny.

Several of the gods are drawn from other pantheons,

sometimes with new names for  the gods. Bane comes

from the Forgotten Realms. From Greyhawk come

Kord, Pelor, Tharizdun, and Vecna. From the Greek

pantheon come Athena (renamed Era this) and Tyche

(renamed Avandra), though both are altered. Set

(renamed Zehir) comes from the Egyptian pantheon.

The Raven Queen is akin to the Norse pantheon's He!

and Greyhawk's Weejas. That leaves three gods created

from scratch: Ioun, Melora, and Torog:

OTHER RELIGIOUS  SYSTEMS

In your campaign, you can create pantheons of gods

who are closely linked in a single religion, monotheistic

religions (worship of a single deity), dualistic systems

(centered on two opposing deities or forces),  mystery

cults (involving personal devotion to a single deity,

usually as part of a pantheon system), anjmistic

religions (revering the spirits inherent in nature), or

even forces and philosophies that don't center on deities.

TIGHT PANTHEONS

In contrast to a loose pantheon, a tight pantheon focuses

on a single religion whose teachings and edicts embrace

a small group of deities. Followers of a tight pantheon

might favor one of its member deities over another,

but they respect all the deities and honor them with

sacrifices and prayer as appropriate.

The key trait to a tight pantheon is that its worshipers

embrace a single ethos or dogma that includes all the

deities. The gods of the tight pantheon work as one to

protect and guide their followers. You can think of a

tight pantheon as similar to a family.  One or two deities

who lead the pantheon serve as parent figures, with

the rest serving as patrons of important aspects of the

culture that worships the pantheon. A single temple

honors all members of the pantheon.

Most tight pantheons have one or more aberrant

gods-deities whose worship isn't sanctioned by the

priests of the pantheon as a whole. These are usually

evil deities and enemies of the pantheon, such as the

Greek Titans. These deities have cults of their own,

attracting social outcasts and villains to their worship.

These cults resemble mystery cults, their members

strictly devoted to their single god, though even

members of aberrant cults pay lip service in the temples

of the tight pantheon.

The Norse deities serve as an example of a tight

pantheon. Odin is the pantheon's leader and father

figure. Deities such as Thor, Tyr,  and Freya embody

important aspects of Norse culture. Meanwhile, Loki

and his devotees lurk in the shadows, sometimes aiding

the other deities, and sometimes working against them

with the pantheon's enemies.

MYSTERY  CULTS

A mystery cult is a secretive religious organization

based on a ritual of initiation, in which the initiate is

mystically identified with a god, or a handful of related

gods. Mystery cults are intensely personal, concerned

with the initiate's relationship with the divine.

Sometimes a mystery cult is a type of worship within

a pantheon. It acknowledges the myths and rituals of

the pantheon, but presents its own myths and rites as

primary. For instance, a secretive order of monks might

immerse themselves in a mystical relationship to a god

who is part of a broadly worshiped pantheon.

A mystery cult emphasizes the history of its god ,

which is symbolically reenacted in its initiation ritual.

The foundation myth of a mystery cult is usually simple

and often involves a god's death and rising, or a journey

to the underworld and a return. Mystery cults often

revere sun and moon deities and agricultural deities

gods whose portfolios reflect the cycles of nature.

DIVINE  RANK

The divine  beings of the multiverse are often categorized

according to their cosmic power.  Some gods are worshiped

on  multiple worlds  and  have a different  rank on  each world,

depending on their influence there.

Greater deities are  beyond  mortal  understanding. They

can't be  summoned, and they are almost always  removed

from  direct involvement in  mortal  affairs.  On  very  rare

occasions they manifest avatars similar to lesser deities,  but

slaying a greater god's avatar has  no effect on the god  itself.

Lesser deities are embodied  somewhere in  the planes.

Some lesser deities live  in  the  Material  Plane,  as  does the

unicorn-goddess  Lurue  of the  Forgotten  Realms  and the

titanic shark-god  Sekolah  revered  by the sahuagin . Others

live  on the Outer Planes,  as  Lolth  does  in  the Abyss.  Such

deities can  be  encountered  by  mortals.

Quasi-deities  have a divine origin,  but they don't hear or

answer prayers,  grant spells to clerics,  or control aspects of

mortal  life. They  are still  immensely powerful  beings, and  in

theory they could ascend to godhood  if they amassed enough

worshipers. Quasi-deities fall  into three subcategories:

demigods, titans, and  vestiges .

Demigods are born  from  the union  of a deity and  a mortal

being. They  have some divine attributes,  but their mortal

parentage  makes them the weakest quasi-deities.

Titans  are the divine creations of deities. They  might be

birthed from  the union  of two  deities,  manufactured on

a divine forge,  born  from  the  blood  spilled  by  a god,  or

otherwise brought about through divine will  or substance.

Vestiges  are deities who  have  lost  nearly  all  their worshipers

and  are considered  dead,  from  a mortal  perspective.  Esoteric

rituals can  sometimes contact these beings and  draw on

their latent  power.

"""'

CHAPTER 1  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR  OWN

TI

The cult's ritual of initiation follows the pattern of its

foundation  myth.  Neophytes retrace the god's footsteps

in order to share the god's ultimate fate.  In the case of

dying and rising gods, the symbolic death of the initiate

represents the idea of death to the old life and rebirth

into a  transformed existence. Initiates are born into

a new life, remaining in the world of mortal affairs

but feeling elevated to a higher sphere. The initiate is

promised a place in the god's realm after death, but also

experiences new meaning in life.

MONOTHEISM

Monotheistic religions revere only one deity, and in

some cases, deny the existence of any other deity. If you

introduce a monotheistic religion into your campaign ,

you need to decide whether other gods exist. Even if

they don't, other religions can exist side by side with

the monotheistic religion. If these religions have clerics

with spellcasting ability, their spells might be powered

by the one true deity, by lesser spirits who aren't deities

(possibly including powerful aberrations, celestials, fey,

fiends, or elementals), or simply by their faith.

The deity of a monotheistic religion has an extensive

portfolio and is portrayed as the creator of everything, in

control of everything, and concerned with every aspect

of existence. Thus, a worshiper of this god offers prayers

and sacrifices to  the same god regardless of what

aspect of life is in need of divine assistance. Whether

marching into war, setting off on a journey, or hoping

to win someone's affections, the worshiper prays to

the same god.

Some monotheistic religions describe different

aspects of their deity. A single god appears in different

aspects as the Creator and the Destroyer, and the clerics

of that god focus on one aspect or the other, determining

their domain access and possibly even their alignment

on that basis. A cleric who venerates the Destroyer

aspect chooses the Tempest or War domain, while

one who worships a Creator aspect chooses the Life

or Nature domains. In some monotheistic religions,

clerics group themselves into distinct religious orders to

differentiate clerics who choose different domains.

DUALISM

A dualistic religion views the world as the stage for

a conflict between two diametrically opposed deities

or divine forces. Most often, the opposed forces are

good and evil, or opposed deities representing those

forces. In some pantheons, the forces or deities of law

and chaos are the fundamental opposites in a dualistic

system. Life and death, light and darkness, rna  ter and

spirit, body and mind, health and illness, purity and

defilement, positive energy and negative energy-the

D&D universe is full of polar opposites that could serve

as the foundation for a dualistic religion. Whatever the

terms in which the dualism is expressed, half of the pair

is usually believed to be good- beneficial, desirable,

or holy-while the other half is considered bad, if not

explicitly evil. If the fundamental conflict in a religion is

expressed as the opposition between matter and spirit,

the followers of that religion believe that one of the two

(usually matter) is evil and the other (spirit) is good, and

so seek to liberate their spirits from this material world

and its evils through asceticism and contemplation.

Rare dualistic systems believe that the two opposing

forces must remain in balance, always pulling away

from each other but remaining bound together in

creative  tension.

In a cosmology defined by an eternal conflict between

good and evil, mortals are expected to ta ke sides. The

majority of those who follow a dualistic religion worship

the deity or force identified as good. Worshipers of

the good deity trust themselves to that god's power to

protect them from the evil deity's minions. Because

the evil  deity in such a religion is usually the source

of everything that is detrimental to existence, only the

perverse and depraved worship this god. Monsters

and fiends serve it, as do certain secretive cults. The

myths of a dualistic religion usually predict that the

good deity will triumph in an apocalyptic battle, but the

forces of evil believe that the outcome of that battle isn't

predetermined and work to promote their deity's victory.

Deities in a dualistic system maintain large portfolios.

All aspects of existence reflect the dualistic struggle,

and therefore all things can fall  on one side or the other

of the conflict. Agriculture, mercy, the sky, medicine,

and poetry reside in the portfolio of the good deity, and

famine , hatred, disease, and war belong to the evil deity.

ANIMISM

Animism is the belief that spirits inhabit every part of

the natural world. In an animistic worldview, everything

has a spirit, from the grandest mountain to the lowliest

rock, from the great ocean to a babbling brook, from the

sun and moon to a fighter's ancestral sword. All these

objects, and the spirits that inhabit them, are sentient,

though some are more aware, alert, and intelligent

than others. The most powerful spirits might even

be considered deities. All  are worthy of respect if not

veneration.

Animists don't typically pay allegiance to one spirit

over the others. Instead, they offer prayers and sacrifices

to different spirits at different times, as appropriate

to the situation. A pious character might make daily

prayers and offerings to ancestor spirits and the spirits

of the house, regular petitions to  important spirits

such as the Seven Fortunes of Good Luck, occasional

sacrifices of incense to location spirits such as the

spirit of a forest, and sporadic prayers to a host of other

spirits as well.

An animistic religion very tolerant. Most spirits don't

care to whom a character also offers sacrifices, as long

as they receive the sacrifices and respect they are due.

As new religions spread through animist lands, those

religions typically win adherents but not converts.

People incorporate new spirits and deities into their

prayers without displacing the old ones. Contemplatives

and scholars adopt complex philosophical systems and

practices without changing their belief in and respect

for  the spirits they already venerate.

Animism functions as a large tight pantheon. Animist

clerics serve the pantheon as a whole, and so can

choose any domain, representing a favorite spirit for

that cleric.

12

CHAPTER  I  j  A  WORLD  Of YOUR OWN

FORCES  AND  PHILOSOPHIES

Not all divine powers need to be derived from deities.

In some campaigns, believers hold enough conviction

in their ideas about the universe that they gain magical  ,  

power from that conviction. In other campaigns,

impersonal forces of nature or magic replace the gods

by granting power to mortals attuned to them. Just as

druids and rangers can gain their spell ability from the

force of nature rather than from a specific nature deity,

some clerics devote themselves to  ideals rather than to

a god. Paladins might serve a philosophy of justice and

chivalry rather than a specific deity.

'

Forces and philosophies aren't worshiped; they aren't

beings that can hear and respond to prayers or accept

sacrifices. Devotion to a philosophy or a force isn't

necessarily exclusive of service to a deity. A person can

be devoted to the philosophy of good and offer worship

to various good deities, or revere the force of nature

and also pay homage to the gods of nature, who might

be seen as personal manifestations of an impersonal

force.  In a world that includes deities with demonstrable

power (through their clerics), it's unusual for a

philosophy to deny the existence of deities, although a

common philosophical belief states that the deities are

more like mortals than they would have mortals  believe.

According to such philosophies, the gods aren't truly

immortal (just very long-lived), and mortals can attain

divinity. In fact,  ascending to godhood is the ultimate

goal of some philosophies.

.

The power of a philosophy stems from the belief that

mortals invest in it. A philosophy that only one person

believes in isn't strong enough to bestow magical power

on that person.

HUMANOIDS  AND  THE  GODS

When it comes to the gods, humans exhibit a far wider

range of beliefs and institutions than other races do. In

many D&D settings, orcs, elves, dwarves, goblins, and

other humanoids have tight pantheons. It is expected

that an ore will worship Gruumsh or one of a handful of

subordinate deities. In comparison, humanity embraces

a staggering variety of deities. Each human culture

might have its own array of gods.

In most D&D settings, there is no single god that

can claim to have created humanity. Thus, the human

proclivity for building institutions extends to religion.

A single charismatic prophet can convert an entire

kingdom to the worship of a new god. With that

prophet's death, the religion might wax or wane, or the

prophet's followers might turn against one another and

found several competing religions.

In comparison, religion in dwarven society is set in

stone. The dwarves of the Forgotten Realms identify

Moradin as their creator. While individual dwarves

might follow other gods, as a culture the dwarves are

pledged to Moradin and the pantheon he leads. His

teachings and magic are so thoroughly ingrained in

dwarven culture that it would take a cataclysmic shift to

replace him.

With that in mind, consider the role of the gods in

your world and their ties to  different humanoid races.

Does each race have a creator god? How does that god



shape that race's culture? Are other folk free of such

divine ties and free to worship as they wish? Has a race

turned against the god that created it? Has a new race

appeared, created by a god within the past few years?

A deity might also have ties to a kingdom, noble

line, or other cultural institution. With the death of

the emperor, a new ruler might be selected by divine

portents sent by the deity who protected the empire in

its earliest days. In such a land, the worship of other

gods might be outlawed or tightly controlled.

Finally, consider the difference between gods who

are tied to specific humanoid races and gods with

more diverse followers. Do the races with their own

pantheons enjoy a place of privilege in your world, with

their gods taking an active role in their affairs? Are the

other races ignored by the gods, or are those races the

deciding factor that can tilt the balance of power in favor

of one god or another?

CHAPTER 1  I A WORLD  OF YOUR  OWN

KINGDOM  SCALE

On a kingdom-scale map, each hex represents 6 miles.

A map at this scale covers a large region, about the size

of Great Britain or half the size of the state of California.

That's plenty of room for adventuring.

The first step of mapping a region at this scale is to

sketch out the coastlines and any major bodies of water

in the area. Is the region landlocked or on a coast? A

coastal region might include islands offshore, and a

landlocked area might include an inland sea or major

lakes. Alternatively, the region could consist of a single

large island, or an isthmus or peninsula with multiple

coastlines.

Next, sketch in any major mountain ranges. Foothills

form a transition between the mountains and lowlands,

and broad patches of gentle hills might dot the region.

That leaves the rest of your map for relatively fiat

terrain: grasslands, forests, swamps, and the like. Place

these elements as you see fit.

Map out the courses of any rivers that flow through

the area. Rivers are born in mountains or inland areas

that see a lot of rainfall, winding down to the nearest

major body of water that doesn't require the river to

cross over higher elevation. Tributaries join rivers as

they grow larger and move toward a lake or the sea.

Finally, place the major towns and cities of the region.

At this scale, you don't need to worry about small towns

and villages, or about mapping every belt of farmland.

Even so, a settled region this size might easily have

eight to twelve cities or towns to put on the map.

CONTINENT SCALE

For mapping a whole continent, use a scale where

1 hex represents 60 miles. At this scale, you can't

see more than the shape of coastlines, the biggest

mountain ranges, major rivers, huge lakes, and political

boundaries. A map at this scale is best for showing how

multiple kingdom-scale maps fi t together, rather than

tracking the movement of adventurers day by day.

The same process you use for  mapping a region at

kingdom scale works for mapping a whole continent.

A continent might have eight to twelve large cities that

deserve a place on the map, most likely major trade

centers and the capitals of kingdoms.

COMBINING SCALES

-~--------------

Whichever scale you start with, it's easy to zoom in or

out on your maps. At continent scale, 1 hex represents

the same area as 10 kingdom-scale hexes. Two cities

that are 3 hexes (180 miles) apart on your continent

map would be 30 hexes apart on your kingdom map,

and might define the opposite ends of the region you're

detailing. At kingdom scale, 1 hex equals 6 province

scale hexes, so it's easy to put the region covered by your

province-scale map into the center of a kingdom-scale

map and create interesting areas around it.

MAPPING YouR CAMPAIGN

When creating the world where your campaign takes

place, you'll want a map. You can take one of two

approaches with it:  top-down or bottom-up. Some DMs

like to start at the top, creating the big picture of the

world at the start of the campaign by having a map

that shows whole continents, and then zooming in on

smaller areas. Other DMs prefer to go the opposite

direction , starting with a small campaign area that is

mapped at a province or kingdom scale, then zooming

out as adventures take the characters into new territory.

Whichever approach you take, hexes work well for

mapping outdoor environments where travel can go

in any direction and calculating distance might be

important. A single sheet of hex paper with 5 hexes to

the inch is ideal for most maps. Use a scale for your map

that's best suited to the level of detail you want. Chapter

7 offers more information about creating and mapping

wilderness areas.

PROVINCE  SCALE

For the most detailed areas of your world, use a

province scale where each hex represents 1 mile. A

full-page  map at this scale represents an area that

can be covered in one day's travel in any direction

from the center of the map, assuming clear terrain. As

such, province scale is a useful scale for mapping a

campaign's starting area (see "Creating a Campaign,"

later in this chapter) or any location where you expect

to track the adventurers' movement in hours rather

than days.



The ground cover of an area this size will include

broad stretches of one predominant terrain type, broken

up by other isolated terrain types.

A settled region mapped at this scale might have one

town and eight to twelve villages or farming hamlets.

A wilder region might have only a single keep, or no

settlements at all. You can also indicate the extent of

the cleared farmland that surrounds each city or town.

On a province-scale map, this will show as a belt a few

hexes wide surrounding each town or village. Even

small villages farm most of the arable land within a

mile or two.

I4

CHAPTER 1  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR OWN

SETTLEMENTS

T he places where people live-bustling cities,

prosperous towns, and tiny villages nestled among

miles of farmland- help define the nature of civilization

in your world. A single settlement- a home base for

your adventurers- is a great place to start a campaign

and begin your world building. Consider the following

questions as you create any settlement in your world:

What purpose does it serve in your game?

How big is it? Who lives there?

What does it look, smell, a-nd sound like?

Who governs it? Who else holds power? Is it part

of a larger state?

What are its defenses?

Where do characters go to find  the goods and services

they need?

What temples and other organizations feature

prominently?

What fantastic elements distinguish it from an

ordinary town?

Why should the characters care about the settlement?

The guidelines in this section are here to help you build

the settlement you want for whatever purpose you have

in mind. Disregard any advice here that runs counter to

your vision for a settlement.

PURPOSE

A settlement exists primarily to facilitate the story

and fun of your campaign. Other than that point, the

settlement's purpose determines the amount of detail

you put into it.  Create only the features of a settlement

that you know you'll need, along with notes on general

features . Then allow the place to grow organically as the

adventurers interact with more and more of it,  keeping

notes on new places you invent.

LOCAL COLOR

A settlement might serve as a place where the

characters stop to rest and to buy supplies. A settlement

of this sort needs no more than a brief description.

Include the settlement's name, decide how big it is,

add a dash of flavor ("The smell of the local tanneries

never lifts from this town"), and let the adventurers get

on with their business. The history of the inn where

the characters spend the night, the mannerisms of the

shopkeeper they buy supplies from-you can add this

level of detail, but you don't have to.  If the characters

return to the same settlement, start adding these local

features so that it begins to feel  a little more like a home

base , albeit a temporary one. Let the settlement develop

as the need arises.

HOME  BASE

A settlement gives the adventurers a place to live,

train, and recuperate between adventures. An entire

campaign can center on a particular town or city.

Such a settlement is the launching pad from which the

characters go  out into the wider world.

Designed well, a home base can hold a special place

in the adventurers' hearts, particularly if they care about

one or more NPCs who live there.

To make a home base come alive, you'll need to

invest some time fl eshing out details, but the players

can help you with  that work. Ask them to  tell you a bit

abou t mentors, family members, and other important

people in their characters' lives. Feel free to add to and

modify what they give you , but you'll start with a solid

foundation of the non player characters (NPCs) who are

important to  the characters. Let the players describe

where and how their characters spend their time- a

favorite  tavern, library, or temple, perhaps.

Using these NPCs and locations as a starting point,

flesh out the settlement's cast of characters. Detail

its leadership, including law enforcement (discussed

later in the chapter). Include characters who can

provide information, such as sages, soothsayers,

librarians, and observant vagabonds. Priests can

provide spellcasting as well as information. Make note

of merchants who might regularly interact with the

adventurers and perhaps compete with one another for

the party's business. Think about the people who run

the adventurers' favorite tavern. And then add a handful

of wild cards: a shady dealer, a mad prophet, a retired

mercenary, a drunken rake, or anyone else who adds a

dash of adventure and intrigue to your campaign.

ADVENTURE  SITE

A village harboring a secret cult of devil worshipers. A

town controlled by a guild of wererats. A city conquered

by a  hobgoblin army. These settlements aren't merely

rest stops but locations where adventures unfold. In

a settlement that doubles as an adventure location,

detail the intended adventure areas, such as towers

and warehouses. For an event-based adventure, note

the NPCs who play a part in the adventure. This

work is adventure preparation as much as it is world

building, and the cast of characters you develop for

your adventure-including allies, patrons, enemies, and

extras- can become recurring figures in your campaign.

SIZE

Most settlements in a D&D world are villages clustered

around a larger town or city. Farming villages supply the

town or city population with food  in exchange for goods

the farmers can't produce themselves. Towns and cities

are the seats of the nobles who govern the surrounding

area, and who carry the responsibility for defending the

villages from attack. Occasionally, a local lord or lady

lives in a keep or fortress with no nearby town or city.

VILLAGE

Population: Up to about 1,000

Government: A noble (usually not a resident) rules the

village, with an appointed agent (a  reeve) in residence

to adjudicate disputes and collect taxes.

Defense: The reeve might have a small force of soldiers.

Otherwise, the village relies on a citizen militia.

Commerce: Basic supplies are readily available,

possibly from an inn or a trading post. Other goods

are available from traveling merchants.

Organizations: A village might contain one or two

temples or shrines, but few or no other organizations.

_ lost settlements are agricultural villages, supporting

themselves and nearby towns or cities with crops and

meat. Villagers produce food  in one way or another-if

not by tending the crops, then supporting those who do

by shoeing horses, weaving clothes, milling grain, and

the like. The goods they produce feed their families and

upply trade with nearby settlements.

A village's population is dispersed around a large area

of land.  Farmers live on their land, which spreads them

videly around the village center. At  the heart of the

\illage, a handful of structures cluster together: a well,

a  ma rketplace, a small temple or two, a gathering place,

and perhaps an inn for travelers.

TowN

Population: Up to about 6 ,000

Government: A resident noble rules and appoints a lord

mayor to oversee administration. An elected town

council represents the interests of the middle class.

Defense: The noble commands a sizable army of

professional soldiers, as well as personal bodyguards.

Commerce: Basic supplies are readily available, though

exotic goods and services are harder to find.  Inns and

taverns support travelers.

Organizations: The town contains several temples,

as well as various merchant guilds and other

organizations.

Towns are major trade centers, situated where important

industries and reliable trade routes enabled the

population to grow. These settlements rely on commerce:

!.he import of raw materials and food from surrounding

illages, and the export of crafted items to those villages,

as well as to  other towns and cities. A town's population

i  more diverse than that of most villages.

Towns arise where roads intersect waterways, at the

meeting of major land trade routes, around strategic

defensive locations, or near significant mines or similar

natural resources.

C ITY

Population: Up to about 25,000

Government: A resident noble presides, with several

other nobles sharing responsibility for surrounding

areas and government functions. One such noble is

the lord mayor, who oversees the city administration.

An elected city council represents the middle class

and might hold more actual power than the lord

mayor.  Other groups serve as important power

centers as well.

Defense: The city supports an army of professional

soldiers, guards, and town watch. Each noble in

residence maintains a small force of personal

bodyguards.

Commerce: Almost any goods or services are readily

available. Many inns and taverns support travelers.

Organizations: A multitude of temples, guilds, and

other organizations, some of which hold significant

power in city affairs, can be found within the

city's walls.

Cities are cradles of civilization. Their larger

populations require considerable support from both

urrounding villages and trade routes, so they're rare.

Cities typically thrive in areas where large expanses

of fertile, arable land surround a location accessible to

trade, almost always on a navigable waterway.

Cities almost always have walls, and the stages of a

city's growth are easily identified by the expansion of

the walls beyond the central core. These internal walls

naturally divide the city into wards (neighborhoods

defined by specific features), which have their own

representatives on the city council and their own noble

administrators.

Cities that hold more than twenty-five thousand people

are extremely rare. Metropolises such as Waterdeep in

the Forgotten Realms, Sharn in Eberron, and the Free

City of Greyhawk stand as vital beacons of civilization in

the D&D worlds.

ATMOSPHERE

- - - - - -

What do  the adventurers first notice as they approach

or enter a settlement? The towering wall bristling

with soldiers? The beggars with hands outstretched,

pleading for aid outside the gate? The noisy hubbub of

merchants and buyers thronging the market square?

The overpowering stench of manure?

Sensory details help bring a settlement to  life and

vividly communicate its personality to your players.

Settle on a single defining factor that sums up a

settlement's personality and extrapolate from  there.

Maybe a city is built around canals, like real-world

Venice. That key element suggests a wealth of sensory

details: the sight of colorful boats floating on muddy

waters, the sound of lapping waves and perhaps singing

gondoliers, the smells of fish  and waste polluting

the water, the feel of humidity. Or perhaps the city is

shrouded in fog much of the time, and you describe the

tendrils of cold mist reaching through every crack and

cranny, the muffled sounds of hooves on cobblestones,

the cold air with the smell of rain, and a sense of

mystery and lurking danger.

The climate and terrain of a settlement's environment,

its origin and inhabitants, its government and political

position, and its commercial importance all have a

bearing on its overall atmosphere. A city nestled against

the edge of a jungle has a very different feel  than one

on the edge of a desert. Elf and dwarf cities present

a distinct aesthetic, clearly identifiable in contrast to

human-built ones. Soldiers patrol the streets to quell

any hint of dissent in a city ruled by a tyrant, while a city

fostering an early system of democracy might boast an

open-air market where philosophical ideas are traded as

freely as produce. All  the possible combinations of these

factors can inspire endless variety in the settlements of

your campaign world.

GOVERNMENT

In the feudal society common in most D&D worlds,

power and authority are concentrated in towns and

cities. Nobles hold authority over the settlements

where they live and the surrounding lands. They collect

taxes from  the populace, which they use for public

building projects, to  pay the soldiery, and to support a

comfortable lifestyle for themselves (although nobles

CHAPTER  1  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR OWN

often have considerable hereditary wealth). In exchange,

they promise to protect their citizens from threats

such as ore marauders, hobgoblin armies, and roving

human bandits.

Nobles appoint officers as their agents in villages, to

supervise the collection of taxes and serve as judges

in disputes and criminal trials. These reeves, sheriffs,

or bailiffs are commoners native to the villages they

govern, chosen for their positions because they already

hold the respect of their fellow citizens.

Within towns and cities, lords share authority and

administrative responsibility with lesser nobles (usually

their own relatives), and also with representatives of

the middle class, such as traders and artisans. A lord

mayor of noble birth is appointed to  head the town or

city council and to  perform the same administrative

functions that reeves carry out in villages. The council

consists of representatives elected by the middle class.

Only foolish nobles ignore the wishes of their councils,

since the economic power of the middle class is often

more important to the prosperity of a town or city than

the hereditary authority of the nobility.

The larger a settlement, the more likely that other

individuals or organizations hold significant power

there as well. Even in a village, a popular individual-a

wise elder or a well-liked farmer-can wield more

influence than the appointed reeve, and a wise reeve

avoids making an enemy of such a person. In towns

and cities, the same power might lie in the hands of a

prominent temple, a guild independent of the council, or

an individual with magical power.

FORMS  OF  GOVERNMENT

A settlement rarely stands alone. A given town or city

might be a theocratic city-state or a prosperous free city

governed by a merchant council. More likely, it's part of

a feudal kingdom, a bureaucratic empire, or a remote

realm ruled by an iron-fisted tyrant. Consider how your

settlement fits into the bigger picture of your world or

region-who rules its ruler, and what other settlements

might also lie under its control.

Typical and fantastical forms of government are

described below. Choose one or randomly determine a

form of government for a nation or city from the Forms

of Government table.

Autocracy. One hereditary ruler wields absolute

power. The autocrat either is supported by a well

developed bureaucracy or military or stands as the

only authority in an otherwise anarchic society. The

dynastic ruler could be immortal or undead. Aundair

and Karrnath, two kingdoms in the Eberron campaign

setting, have autocrats with royal blood in their veins.

Whereas Queen Aurala of Aundair relies on wizar.ds

and spies to enforce her will, Kaius, the vampire king of

Karrnath, has a formidable army of living and undead

soldiers under his command.

Bureaucracy. Various departments compose the

government, each responsible for an aspect of rule. The

department heads, ministers, or secretaries answer to  a

figurehead autocrat or council.

Confederacy. Each individual city or town within

the confederacy governs itself, but all contribute to a

league or federation that promotes (at least in theory)

the common good of all member states. Conditions and

attitudes toward the central government vary from  place

to place within the confederacy. The Lords' Alliance in

the Forgotten Realms setting is a loose confederacy of

cities, while the Mror Holds in the Eberron campaign

setting is a confederacy of allied dwarf clans.

Democracy. Citizens or their elected representatives

determine the laws in a democracy. A bureaucracy or

military carries out the day-to-day work of government,

with positions filled through open elections.

Dictatorship. One supreme ruler holds absolute

authority, but his or her rule isn't necessarily dynastic.

In other respects this resembles an autocracy. In the

Greyhawk campaign setting, a  half-demon named Iuz is

the dictator of a conquered land that bears his name.

Feudalism. The typical government of Europe in

the Middle Ages, a feudalistic society consists of layers

of lords and vassals. The vassals provide soldiers or

scutage (payment in lieu of military service) to the lords,

who in turn promise protection to their vassals.

Gerontocracy. Elders preside over this society. In

some cases, long-lived races such as elves or dragons

are entrusted with the leadership of the land.

Hierarchy. A feudal or bureaucratic government

where every member, except one, is subordinate to

another member. In the Dragonlance campaign setting,

the dragonarmies of Krynn form a military hierarchy,

with the Dragon Highlords as leaders under the dragon

queen Takhisis.

Kleptocracy. This government is composed of groups

or individuals primarily seeking wealth for themselves,

often at the expense of their subjects. The grasping

Bandit Kingdoms in the Grey hawk campaign setting

are prime examples. A kingdom run by thieves' guilds

would also fall into this category.

Magocracy. The governing body is composed of

spellcasters who rule directly as oligarchs or feudal

lords, or participate in a democracy or bureaucracy.

Examples include the Red Wizards of Thay in the

Forgotten Realms campaign setting and the sorcerer

kings of Athas in the Dark Sun campaign setting.

Matriarchy or Patriarchy. This society is governed

by the eldest or most important members of one gender.

Draw cities are examples of theocratic matriarchies, for

18

CHAPTER  1  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR OWN

each is ruled by a council of drow high priestesses who

answer to Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders.

Meritocracy. The most intelligent and educated

people oversee the society, often with a bureaucracy

to  handle the day-to-day work of government. In the

Forgotten Realms, scholarly monks preside over the

fo rtress-library of Candlekeep, overseen by a master of

lore called the Keeper.

Militocracy.  Military leaders run the nation under

ma rtial law, using the army and other armed forces. A

militocracy might be based on an elite group of soldiers,

an order of dragon riders , or a league of sea princes.

olamnia, a nation ruled by knights in the Dragonlance

ca mpaign setting, falls into this category.

Monarchy. A single hereditary sovereign wears the

crow n. Unlike the autocrat, the monarch's powers are

limited by law, and the ruler serves as the head of a

democracy, feudal state, or militocracy. The kingdom

of Breland, in the Eberron campaign setting, has both

a  parliament that makes laws and a  monarch who

enfo rces them.

Oligarchy. A small number of absolute rulers share

power, possibly dividing the land into districts or

provinces under their control, or jointly ruling together.

_.\group of adventurers who take control of a nation

together might form an oligarchy. The Free City of

Greyhawk is an oligarchy composed of various faction

leaders, with a Lord Mayor as its figurehead.

Plutocracy. Society is governed by the wealthy. The

elite form a ruling council, purchase representati"on at

rhe court of a figurehead monarch, or rule by default

because money is the true power in  the realm. Many

cities in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting,

including Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate, are plutocracies.

Republic. Government is entrusted to representatives

of an established electorate who rule on behalf of the

electors. Any democracy in which only landowners or

certain classes can vote could be considered a republic.

Satrapy. Conquerors and representatives of another

government wield power, ruling the settlement or region

as  part of a larger empire. The satraps are bureaucrats

and military officers, or unusual characters or monsters.

The cities of High port and Suder ham in the Greyhawk

ca mpaign setting are satrapies controlled by agents of a

,icious gang of marauders known as the Slave Lords.

Theocracy. Rulership falls to a direct representative

or a collection of agents of a deity. The centers of power

in a theocracy are usually located on sacred sites. In

the Eberron campaign setting, the nation of Thrane is

a theocracy devoted to the Silver Flame, a divine spirit

that resides in Thrane's capital of Flamekeep.

COMMERCE

Even small villages can provide characters access to the

gear they need to pursue their adventures. Provisions,

tents, backpacks, and simple weapons are commonly

available. Traveling merchants carry armor, martial

weapons, and more specialized gear. Most villages have

inns that cater to travelers, where adventurers can find

a hot meal and a bed, even if the quality leaves much to

be desired.

Villages rely heavily on trade with other settlements,

including larger towns and cities . Merchants pass

through regularly, selling necessities and luxuries to the

vil,Iagers, and any successful merchant has far-reaching

contacts across the region. Traveling merchants pass

on gossip and adventure hooks to the characters as

they conduct their business. Since merchants make

their living traversing roads that might be menaced

by bandits or wandering monsters, they hire guards to

keep their goods safe. They also carry news from town

to town, including reports of situations that cry out for

the attention of adventurers.

These merchants can't provide the services normally

found in a city. For instance, when the characters are in

need of a library or a dedicated sage, a trainer who can

handle the griffon eggs they've found , or an architect to

design their castle, they're better off going to a large city

than looking in a village.

CURRENCY

The straightforward terms "gold piece" (gp), "silver

piece" (sp), "copper piece" (cp), "electrum piece" (ep),

and "platinum piece" (pp) are used throughout the game

rules for clarity. You can imbue these denominations

with more interesting descriptions in your game

world. People give coins specific names, whether

as plain as "dime" or lively as "gold double-eagle." A

country typically mints its own currency, which might

correspond to the basic rules terms. In most worlds, few

currencies achieve widespread distribution, but nearly

all coins are accepted worldwide-except by those

looking to pick a fight with a foreigner.

ExAMPLE :  THE FoRGOTTEN REALMS

The world of the Forgotten Realms provides an

extensive example of currencies. Although barter,

blood notes, and similar letters of trade are common

enough in Faerfin, metal coins and trade bars are the

everyday currency.

Common Coinage. Coins appear in a bewildering

variety of shapes, sizes, names, and materials. Thanks

to the ambitious traders of Sembia, that nation's oddly

shaped coins can be found  throughout Faerfin. In

S embia, square iron steelpence replace copper coins.

Triangular silver pieces are ravens, diamond-shaped

electrum pieces are harmarks (commonly called "blue

eyes"), and five-sided gold pieces are nobles. Sembia

doesn't mint platinum coins. All coinage is accepted

in Sembia, including copper and platinum pieces

from abroad.

In Waterdeep, the bustling cosmopolitan center

of trade, coppers are called nibs, silvers are shards,

CHAPTER 1  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR OWN

19

electrum pieces are moons, gold  pieces are dragons,

and platinum coins are suns. The city's two local coins

are the toal and the harbor moon. The toal is a square

brass trading-coin pierced with a central hole to  permit

it to be easily strung on a ring or string, worth 2 gp in

the city and nothing outside Waterdeep. The harbor

moon is a flat crescent of platinum with a central

hole and an electrum inlay, named for  its traditional

use in the docks for  buying large amounts of cargo at

once. The coin is worth 50 gp in Waterdeep and 30 gp

elsewhere.

The northern city of Silverymoon mints a crescent

shaped , shining blue coin called an electrum moon,

worth 1 gp in that city and 1 ep elsewhere. The city also

issues a larger coin called an eclipsed moon, which

looks like an electrum moon combined a darker silver

wedge to  form a round coin worth 5 ep within the city

and 2 ep outside it.

The favored form of currency in the kingdom of

Cormyr is the royal coinage of the court, stamped with

a dragon on one side and a treasury date mark on the

other. There, coppers are called thumbs, silvers are

silver falcons, electrum pieces are blue eyes, gold pieces

are golden lions, and platinum coins are tricrowns.

Even city-states mint their own copper, silver, and gold

pieces. Electrum and platinum pieces are rarer in these

lands. Smaller states use coinage borrowed from other

nations and looted from ancient sources. Travelers from

certain lands (notably the wizard-dominated realms of

Thay and Halruaa) use the currencies of other realms

when trading abroad because their own coins and

tokens are feared to be magically cursed, and so are

s hunned by others.

Conversely, the coins of long-lost, legendary lands

and centers of great magic are honored, though those

who find  them are wise to sell them to collectors rather

than merely spending them in markets. The coins of the

old elven court of Cormanthyr are particularly famous:

thalvers (coppers), bedoars (silvers), thammarchs

(electrum), shilmaers (golds), and ruendils (platinum).

These coins a re fine , numerous, and sometimes still

used in trade among elves.

CHAPTER 1  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR OWN

Trade Bars. Large numbers of coins can be difficult

to  transport and account for.  Many merchants prefer

to  use trade bars-ingots of precious metals and alloys

(usually silver) likely to be accepted by virtually anyone.

Trade bars are stamped or graven with the symbol of the

trading company or government that originally crafted

them. These bars are valued by weight, as follows:

A 2-pound silver bar is worth  10 gp and is about 5

inches long, 2 inches wide, and  1/2 inch thick.

A 5-pound silver bar is worth 25 gp and is about 6

inches long, 2 inches wide, and 1 inch thick.

A 5-pound gold bar is worth 250 gp and is about the

size of a  2-pound silver bar.

The city of Baldur's  Gate mints large numbers of

silver trade bars and sets the standard for  this form of

currency. The city of Mirabar issues black iron spindle

shaped trade bars with squared ends weighing about

2 pounds each, worth 10 gp in that city, markedly less

in nearby trade centers , a nd as iron is normally valued

elsewhere (1  sp per pound).

Odd Currency.  Coins and bars aren't the only forms

of hard currency. Gond bells are small brass bells worth

10 gp in trade, or 20 gp to a temple of Gond. Shaar

rings, pierced and polished slices of ivory threaded

onto strings by the nomads of the Shaar, are worth 3 gp

per slice.

CREATING YouR OwN

As shown in the previous examples, currency doesn't

need to obey a universal standard in your world. Each

country and era can have its own coins with its own

values. Your adventurers might travel through many

different lands and find long-lost treasures. Finding

six hundred ancient bed oars from the rule of Coronal

Eltargrim twelve centuries before offers a deeper sense

of immersion in your world than finding 60 sp.

Varying names and descriptions of coins for  the

major contemporary and historical realms of your world

adds an additional layer of texture. The golden lions of

Cormyr convey the noble nature of that kingdom. If a

nation mints gold coins stamped with leering demonic

faces and called torments, that currency expresses a

distinct flavor.

Creating new coins connected to specific locations,

like the toals ofWaterdeep or the eclipsed moons of

Silverymoon, provides another level of detail. As long as

you keep the value of these new coins simple (in  other

words, don't invent a coin worth 1.62 gp), you add local

flavor to key locations in your world without adding

undue complexity.

LANGUAGES AND  DIALECTS

When fleshing out your world, you can create new

languages and dialects to  reflect its unique geography

and history. You can replace the default languages

presented in the Player's Handbook with new ones, or

split languages up into several different dialects.

In some worlds, regional differences might be much

more important than racial ones. Perhaps all the

dwarves, elves, and humans who live in one kingdom

speak a common language, which is completely different

11ARPER5

ORDER  OF  THE  GAUNTLET

EMERALD  ENCLAVE

LoRDs'  ..ALLIANCE

ZHENTARIM

fro m that spoken in the neighboring kingdom. This

m ight make communication (and diplomacy) between

rwo kingdoms significantly more difficult.

Widely used languages might have ancient versions,

or there might be completely different ancient tongues

that adventurers find written in tombs and ruins. Such

languages can add an element of mystery to inscriptions

and tomes that characters encounter.

You might invent additional secret languages , besides

Druidic and thieves' cant, that allow members of certain

organizations or political affiliations to communicate.

You could even decide that each alignment has its

own language, which might be more of an argot used

primarily to discuss philosophical concepts.

In a region where one race has subjugated another,

the language of the conquerors can become a mark of

ocial status. Similarly, reading and writing might be

restricted by law to  the upper classes of a society.

FACTIONS AND

ORGANIZATIONS

Temples, guilds, orders, secret societies, and

colleges are important for.ces in the social order of

any civilization. Their influence might stretch across

multiple towns and cities, with or without a similarly

wide-ranging political authority. Organizations can

play an important part in the Jives of player characters,

becoming their patrons, allies, or enemies just like

ind ividual non player characters. When characters join

these organizations, they become part of something

larger than themselves, which can give their adventures

a context in the wider world.

ADVENTURERS  AND  ORGANIZATIONS

At the start of a campaign, backgrounds are a great

way to connect adventurers to your world. As the game

progresses, though, background ties often become less

important.

Factions and organizations aimed at player characters

are a way to keep higher-level adventurers connected

m your world, providing ties to key NPCs and a clear

agenda beyond individual gain. In the same way,

Yillainous organizations create an ongoing sense of

menace above and beyond the threat of solitary foes.

Having different characters tied to different factions

can create interesting situations at the gaming table, as

long as those factions have similar goals and don't work

in opposition to one another all the time. Adventurers

representing different factions might have competing

interests or priorities while they pursue the same goals.

Adventurer organizations are also a great source of

special rewards beyond experience points and treasure.

Increased standing in an organization has value in and

of itself, and might also come with concrete benefits

such as access to an organization's information,

equipment, magic, and other resources.

CREATING FACTIONS

Factions and organizations that you  create for your

campaign should grow out of the stories that are

important to the world. Create organizations that your

players will want to interact with, whether as allies,

members, or enemies.

As a starting point, decide what role you want an

organization to play in  the world. What is it all about?

What are its goals? Who founded it and why? What do

its members do? Answering these questions should

SAMPLE  FACTION: THE  HARPERS

The  Harpers  is  a scattered  network of spellcasters  and  spies

who advocate equality and  covertly oppose the  abuse of

power,  magical or otherwise.

The organization  has  risen , been  shattered, and  risen

again  several  times.  Its  longevity and  resilience are  largely

due to its  decentralized, grassroots, secretive nature, and the

autonomy of its  various  members. The  Harpers  have  small

cells  and  lone operatives  throughout the  Forgotten  Realms,

although they  interact and  share  information with  one

another from time to time as  needs warrant. The  Harpers'

ideology is  noble, and  its  members pride themselves  on  their

ingenuity and  incorruptibility.  Harpers don't seek  power or

glory,  only fair and  equal treatment for all .

Motto.  "Down with tyranny.  Fairness  and  equality for all."

Beliefs. The  Harpers' beliefs  can  be  summarized as  follows:

One can  never have too much  information or arcane

knowledge.

Too  much  power leads to corruption, and the abuse of

magic in  particular must be  closely monitored.

No one  should  be  powerless .

Goals.  Gather information throughout FaerCln,  discern

the political dynamics within  each  region,  and  promote

fairness  and  equality by  covert means . Act openly as  a last

resort. Thwart tyrants  and  any  leader,  government, or group

that grows too powerful. Aid the weak, the poor,  and  the

oppressed .

Typical Quests. Typical  Harper quests  include securing

an  artifact that would  upset the balance of power in  a

region,  gathering information on  a powerful  individual  or

organization , and  determining the true intentions of an

ambitious political figur~ or evil  spellcaster.

CHAPTER  l  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR  OWN

21

give you a good sense of the organization's personality.

From there, think about typical members. How might

people describe them? What are the typical members'

classes and alignments? What personality traits do they

tend to share?

Advancing an organization's interests increases

a character's renown within that organization by  1.

Completing a mission specifically assigned by that

organization, or which directly benefits the organization,

increases the character's renown by 2 instead.

Choosing a symbol and a motto for the organization

For example, characters with connections to the noble

is a way of summing up the work you've done so far.

A faction that uses a stag as a symbol probably has a

very different personality from one that uses a winged

viper.  For a motto, choose not just a message but also

a tone and style of speech that fits  the organization as

you've defined it.  Consider the motto of the Harpers:

"Down with tyranny.  Fairness and equality for all." The

Harpers have a straightforward message of freedom

and prosperity. Contrast that with the motto of a

group of politically allied cities in the North calling

themselves the Lords' Alliance: "Threats to home must

be terminated without prejudice. Superiority is our

security."  These are sophisticated people involved in

a delicate political alliance, with more emphasis on

stability than on fairness and equality.

Finally, think about the ways that player characters

might come into contact with the organization. Who

are the important members-not just the leaders,

but the agents in the field  that the adventurers might

encounter? Where are they active, and where do they

have headquarters or strongholds? If adventurers do

join, what kind of missions might they be sent on? What

rewards can they gain?

RENOWN

Renown is an optional rule you can use to track an

adventurer's standing within a particular faction or

organization. Renown is a numerical value that starts

at 0, then increases as a character earns favor and

reputation within a particular organization. You can tie

benefits to a character's renown, including ranks and

titles within the organization and access to  resources.

A player tracks renown separately for each

organization his or her character is a member of.  For

example, an adventurer might have 5 renown within

one faction and 20 renown within another, based on the

character's interaction with each organization over the

course of the campaign.

GAINING RENOWN

A character earns renown by completing missions or

quests that serve an organization's interests or involve

the organization directly. You award renown at your

discretion as characters complete these missions

or quests, typically at the same time you award

experience points.

EXAMPLES  OF  FACTION  RANKS

Order of the Gauntlet complete a mission in which

they free a town from the tyranny of a blue dragon.

Because the order likes to  punish evildoers, you might

increase each character's  renown within the order

by 1.  Conversely, if killing the dragon was a mission

given to the adventurers by a senior member of the

order, completing the task might instead increase each

character's  renown by 2, showing the adventurers as

effective allies.

Meanwhile, the party's rogue might have looted a box

of rare poisons from the dragon's hoard and sold  it to

a fence who is secretly a Zhentarim agent. You might

increase the rogue's renown within the Zhentarim by 2

since this action directly increased that group's power

and wealth, even though the task was not assigned by an

agent of the Zhentarim.

BENEFITS  OF  RENOWN

The benefits of increasing renown within an

organization can include rank and authority, friendly

attitudes from members of the organization, and

other perks.

Rank. Characters can earn promotions as their

renown increases. You  can establish certain thresholds

of renown that serve as prerequisites (though not

necessarily the only prerequisites) for advancing in

rank, as shown in the Examples of Faction Ranks table.

For example, a character might join the Lords' Alliance

after earning 1 renown within that organization, gaining

the title of cloak. As the character's renown within the

organization increases, he or she might be eligible for

further increases in rank.

You can add rank prerequisites. For example, a

character affiliated with the Lords' Alliance might have

to  be at least 5th level before becoming a stingblade, at

least lOth level to  be a warduke, and at least 15th level

to be a lioncrown.

You can set these thresholds of renown to any

numbers that work for your game, creating appropriate

ranks and titles for the organizations in your campaign.

Attitudes of Organization Members. As a character's

renown within an organization grows, members of

that organization are increasingly likely to have heard

of the character. You can set thresholds at which the

default attitude of an organization's members toward

the character becomes indifferent or friendly. For

example, members of the Emerald Enclave- a faction

dedicated to preserving the natural order-might be

less friend ly toward characters who have not cultivated

at least 3 renown within that organization, becoming

riendly by default only when a character has gained 10

renown within the Emerald Enclave. These thresholds

apply only to the default attitude of most members of an

organization, and such attitudes aren't automatic. NPC

faction members might dislike an adventurer despite

that character's renown-or perhaps because of it.

Perks. Earning a rank within an organization comes

with certain benefits, as defined by you. A character of

low rank might gain access to a reliable contact and

adventure leads, a safe house, or a trader willing to

offer a discount on adventuring gear. A middle-ranked

cha racter might gain a follower (see chapter 4,  "Creating

_ -onplayer Characters"), access to potions and scrolls,

the ability to call in a favor,  or backup on dangerous

missions. A high-ranking character might be able to

call  on a small army, take custody of a rare magic item,

gain access to a helpful spellcaster, or assign special

missions to members of lower rank.

Downtime Activities. You might allow characters

to spend downtime between adventures building

;elationships and gaining renown within an

organization. For more information on downtime

activities, see chapter 6, "Between Adventures."

L OSING RENOWN

Disagreements with members of an organization

a ren't enough to cause a loss of renown within that

organization. However, serious offenses committed

against the organization or its members can result

in a loss of renown and rank within the organization.

The extent of the loss depends on the infraction and is

left to your discretion. A character's renown within an

organization can never drop below 0.

PI ETY

\Vith a few alterations, the renown system can also

erve as a measure of a character's link to the gods. It's

a great option for campaigns where the gods take active

roles in the world.

Using this approach, you track renown based on

pecific divine figures in your campaign. Each character

bas  the option to select a patron deity or pantheon with

goals, doctrine, and taboos that you have created. Any

renown he or she earns is called piety. A character

gains piety for honoring his or her gods, fulfilling their

commands,. and respecting their taboos. A character

loses piety for working against those gods, dishonoring

them, defiling their temples, and foiling their aims.

The gods bestow favors on those who prove their

devotion. With each rank of piety gained, a character

can pray for divine favor once per day.  This favor usually

comes in the form of a cleric spell like bless. The favor

ofte n comes with a sign of the divine benefactor; for

example, a character dedicated to Thor might receive a

pel!  accompanied by the boom of thunder.

A high level of piety can also lead to a character

gaining a more persistent benefit, in the form of a

blessing or charm (see chapter 7,  "Treasure," for such

upernatural gifts).

MAGIC  IN YouR WoRLD

In most D&D worlds, magic is natural but still wondrous

and sometimes frightening. People everywhere know

about magic, and most people see evidence of it at some

point in their lives. It permeates the cosmos and moves

through the ancient possessions of legendary heroes,

the mysterious ruins of fallen empires, those touched

by the gods, creatures born with supernatural power,

and individuals who study the secrets of the multiverse.

Histories and fireside tales are filled with the exploits of

those who wield it.

What normal folk know of magic depends on where

th.ey live and whether they know characters who

practice magic. Citizens of an isolated hamlet might not

have seen true magic used for generations and speak

in whispers of the strange powers of the old hermit

living in the nearby woods. In the city of Waterdeep

in the Forgotten Realms setting, the Watchful Order

of Magists and Protectors is a guild of wizards. These

arcanists wish to make wizardry more accessible so the

order's members can profit from selling their services.

Some D&D settings have more magic in them than

others. On Athas, the harsh world of the Dark Sun

setting, arcane magic is a hated practice that can drain

life from the world. Much of Athas's magic lies in the

hands of evildoers. Conversely, in the world of Eberron,

magic is as commonplace as any other commodity.

Mercantile houses sell magic items and services to

SAMPLE  FACTION: THE  ZHENTARIM

The Zhentarim  (also  known  as the  Black  Network)  is  an

unscrupulous shadow network that seeks to expand  its

influence  and  power throughout the Forgotten  Realms.

The  public face  of the  Black  Network appears  relatively

benign.  It  offers the  best and cheapest goods and  services,

both  legal  and  illicit, thus destroying its  competitors and

making everyone dependent on  it.

A member of the Zhentarim thinks of himself or herself

as  a member of a very  large family  and  relies  on the  Black

Network for  resources  and  security.  However,  members are

granted the autonomy to  pursue their own  interests and  gain

some measure of personal wealth  and  influence. As  a whole,

the Zhentarim  promises "the best of the  best,"  although

in  truth the organization  is  more  interested  in  spreading

its own  propaganda and  influence than  investing in  the

improvement of its  individual  members.

Motto.  "join  us  and  prosper. Oppose us  and  suffer."

Beliefs. The Zhentarim's  beliefs  can  be  summarized

as follows:

The Zhentarim  is  your family.  You  watch  out for  it,  and  it

watches out for you.

You  are the master of your own  destiny.  Never  be  less than

what you  deserve to  be.

Everything and  everyone  has  a price.

Goals. Amass wea lth,  power,  and  influence,  and  thereby

dominate  Faerun .

Typical Quests. Typical  Zhentarim quests  include

plundering or stealing a treasure hoard,  powerful  magic item ,

or artifact;  securing a lucrative  business contract or enforcing

a preexisting one;  and  establishing a foothold  in  a place

where the Zhentarim  holds  little  sway.

C H APTER  I  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR  OWN

23

anyone who can afford them. People purchase tickets to

ride airships and trains propelled by elemental magic.

Consider these questions -when fitting magic into

your world:

Is some magic common? Is some socially

unacceptable? Which magic is rare?

How unusual are members of each spellcasting

class? How common are those who can cast high

level spells?

How rare are magic items, magical locations,

and creatures that have supernatural powers? At

what power level do these things go from everyday

to exotic?

How do authorities regulate and use magic? How

do  normal folks use magic and protect them

selves from it?

The answers to  some questions suggest the answers

to others. For example, if spell casters of low-level

spells are common, as in Eberron, then authorities and

common folk are more likely to  have access to and use

the results of such spells. Buying commonplace magic

isn't only possible, but also less expensive. People are

more likely to keep well-known magic in mind, and to

protect against it, especially in risky situations.

RESTRICTIONS  ON  MAGIC

Some civilized areas might restrict or prohibit the use

of magic. Spellcasting might be forbidden without a

license or official permission. In such a place, magic

items and continual magical effects are rare, with

protections against magic being the exception.

Some localities might prohibit specific spells. It could

be a crime to cast any spells used to steal or swindle,

such as those that bestow invisibility or produce

illusions. Enchantments that charm or dominate others

are readily outlawed, since they rob their subjects of

free will. Destructive spells are likewise prohibited, for

obvious reasons. A local ruler could have a phobia about

a specific effect or spell (such as shapeshifting effects if

he or she were afraid of being impersonated) and enact

a law restricting that type of magic.

SCHOOLS  OF  MAGIC

The rules of the game refer to the schools of magic

(abjuration, illusion, necromancy, and so on), but it's

up to you to determine what those schools signify in

your world. Similarly, a few class options suggest the

existence of magic-using organizations in the world

bardic colleges and druid circles- which are up to you to

flesh  out.



You could decide that no formal structures like these

exist in your world. Wizards (and bards and druids)

might be so rare that a player character learns from a

single mentor and never meets another character of the

same class, in which case wizards would learn their

school specialization without any formal training.

However, if magic is more common, academies can

be the embodiments of the schools of magic. These

institutions have their own hierarchies, traditions,

regulations, and procedures. For example, Materros

the necromancer could be a brother of the necromantic

CHAPTER 1  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR  OWN

Cabal of Thar-Zad. As a sign of his high standing within

its hierarchy, he is allowed to wear the red and green

robes of a master. Of course, when he wears these

robes, his occupation is easily identified by those who

know of the cabal. This recognition could be a boon or

a nuisance, since the Cabal of Thar-Zad has a fearsome

reputation.

If you go this route, you can treat schools of magic,

bardic colleges, and druid circles as organizations,

using the guidelines for organizations presented earlier

in this chapter. A player character necromancer might

cultivate renown within the Cabal of Thar-Zad, while

a bard seeks increasing renown within the College of

Mac-Fuirmidh.

TELEPORTATION  CIRCLES

The presence of permanent teleportation circles in

major cities helps cement their important place in the

economy of a fantasy world. Spells such as plane shift,

teleport, and teleportation circle connect with these

circles, which are found in  temples, academies, the

headquarters of arcane organizations, and prominent

civic locations. However, since every teleportation circle

is a possible means of entry into a city,  they're guarded

by military and magical protection.

As you design a fantasy city, think about the

teleportation circles it might contain and which ones

adventurers are likely to know about. If the adventurers

commonly return to their home base by means of

a teleportation circle, use that circle as a hook for

plot developments in your campaign. What do the

adventurers do if they arrive in a teleportation circle and

find  all the familiar wards disabled and guards lying

in pools of blood? What if their arrival interrupts an

.argument between two feuding priests at the temple?

Adventure ensues!

BRINGING  BACK THE  DEAD

When a creature dies, its soul departs its body,  leaves

the Material Plane, travels through the Astral Plane,

and goes to abide on the plane where the creature's

deity resides. If the creature didn't worship a deity, its

soul departs to the plane corresponding to its alignment.

Bringing someone back from the dead means retrieving

the soul from that plane and returning it to  its body.

Enemies can take steps to make it more difficult for

a character to be returned from the dead. Keeping

the body prevents others from using raise dead or

resurrection to  restore the slain character to  life.

A soul can't be returned to life if it doesn't wish to

be. A soul knows the name, alignment, and patron

deity (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and

might refuse to  return on  that basis. For example, if

the honorable knight Sturm Brightblade is slain and a

high priestess of Takhisis (god of evil dragons) grabs

his body, Sturm might not wish to be raised from the

dead by her. Any attempts she makes to revive him

automatically fail.  If the evil cleric wants to revive Sturm

to interrogate him, she needs to find some way to trick

his soul, such as duping a good cleric into raising him

and then capturing him once he is alive again.

CREATING A  CAMPAIGN

The world you create is the stage for the

adventures you set in it. You  don't have to  give more

thought to  it than that. You  can run adventures in

an episodic format , with the characters as the only

common element, and also weave themes throughout

those adventures to build a greater saga of the

characters' achievements in the world.

P lanning an entire campaign might seem like a

daunting task, but you don't have to plot out every

detail right from the start. You  can start with the

basics, running a few adventures, and think about

larger plotlines you want to explore as the campaign

progresses. You're free to add as much or as little detail

a  you wish.

T he start of a campaign resembles the start of an

adventure. You  want to jump quickly into the action,

how the players that adventure awaits, and grab

their attention right away.  Give the players enough

information to make them want to come back week after

eek to see how the story plays out.

START SMALL

\" hen you first start building your campaign, start

mall.  The characters need to know only about the

city, town, or village where they start the game, and

perhaps the nearby dungeon. You  might decide that

the barony is at war with a nearby duchy, or that a

dista nt forest is crawling with ettercaps and giant

piders, and you should note these things. But at

the start of the game, the local area is enough to  get

the campaign off the ground. Follow these steps to

create that local area:

1.  CREATE A  HOME BASE

ee the "S ettlements" section earlier in this chapter

;"or guidance on building this settlement. A small

own or village at the edge of the wilderness serves

a fine home base in most D&D campaigns. Use

a la rger town or city if you want a campaign with

rban adventuring.

2.  CREATE A  LOCAL REGION

ee "Mapping the Campaign" earlier in this chapter

:or guidance. Draw a map at province scale (1  hex=

l  mile) with the home base near the center. Fill

n the area within a day's travel-about 25 to 30

:niles-of the home base. Pepper it with two to

:our dungeons or similar adventure locales .

. -ill area that size is likely to have one to three

additional settlements as well as the home base,

so give thought to them as well.

3.  CRAFT A  STARTING ADVENTURE

ingle dungeon makes a good first adventure

'or most campaigns. See chapter 3, "Creating

_ dventures,"  for guidance.

A home base provides a common starting

.ocation for  the characters. This starting point

might be the village where they grew up or a

ci _- that attracted them from points beyond.

Or perhaps they begin the campaign in the dungeons

of an evil baron's castle where they've been locked up

for various reasons (legitimate or otherwise), throwing

them into the midst of the adventure.

For each of these steps, give the locations only as

much detail as they need. You don't need to identify

every building in a village or label every street in a large

city. If the characters start in the baron's dungeon , you'll

need the details of this first adventure site, but you

don't have to name all the baron's knights. Sketch out

a simple map, think about the surrounding area, and

consider whom the characters are most likely to interact

with early in the campaign. Most important, visualize

how this area fits  into the theme and story you have in

mind for your campaign. Then start working on your

first adventure!

SET THE  STAGE

As you start to develop your campaign , you'll need to

fill  in the players on the basics. For easy distribution,

compile essential information into a campaign

handout. Such a handout typically includes the

following material:

Any restrictions or new options for character creation,

such as new or prohibited races.

Any information in the backs tory of your campaign

that the characters would know about. If you have

a theme or direction in mind for  the campaign, this

information could include seeds hinting at that focus .

Basic information about the area where the characters

are starting, such as the name of the town, important

locations in and around it, prominent NPCs they'd

know about, and perhaps rumors that point to trouble

that's brewing.

Keep this handout short and to the point. Two pages

is a reasonable maximum. Even if you have a burst of

creative energy that produces twenty pages of great

background material, save it for your adventures. Let

the players uncover the details gradually in play.

INVOLVING THE  CHARACTERS

Once you've identified what your campaign is about,

let the players help tell the story by deciding how their

characters are involved. This is their opportunity to

tie their characters' history and background to the

campaign, a nd a chance for you to determine how the

various elements of each character's background tie

into the campaign's story. For example, what secret has

the hermit character learned? What is the status of the

noble character's family? What is the folk hero's  destiny?

Some players might have trouble coming up with

ideas-not everyone is equally inventive. You can help

spur their creativity with a few  questions about their

characters:

Are you a  native, born and raised in the area? If so,

who's your family? What's your current occupation?

Are you a  recent arrival? Where did you come from?

Why did you come to  this area?

CHAPTER  I  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR OWN

Are you tied to any of the organizations or people

involved in the events that kick off the campaign? Are

they friends or enemies?

Listen to the players' ideas, and say yes if you can.

Even if you want all  the characters to have grown up in

the starting town, consider allowing a recent arrival or

a transplant if the player's story is convincing enough.

Suggest alterations to a character's story so it better fits

your world, or weave the first threads of your campaign

into that story.

CREATING A  BACKGROUND

Backgrounds are designed to root player characters

in  the world, and creating new backgrounds is a great

way to introduce players to the special features of your

world. Backgrounds that have ties to particular cultures,

organizations, and historical events from your campaign

are particularly strong. Perhaps the priests of a certain

religion live as beggars supported by a pious populace,

singing the tales of their deity's exploits to entertain

and enlighten the faithful. You could create a mendicant

priest background (or modify the acolyte background)

to  reflect these qualities. It could include musical

instrument proficiency, and its feature probably involves

receiving hospitality from the faithful.

Guidelines for creating a new background are

provided in chapter 9,  "Dungeon Master's Workshop."

CAMPAIGN  EVENTS

Significant events in the history of a fantasy world tend

toward immense upheavals: wars that pit the forces

of good against evil in an epic confrontation, natural

disasters that lay waste to entire civilizations, invasions

of vast armies or extra planar hordes, assassinations

of world leaders. These world-shaking events title the

chapters of history.

In a D&D game, such events provide the sparks that

can ignite and sustain a campaign. The most common

pitfall of serial stories without a set beginning, mfddle,

and end is inertia. Like many television shows and

comic-book series, a D&D campaign runs the risk of

retreading the same ground long after the enjoyment's

gone. Just as actors or writers drift away from  those

other mediums, so can players- the actors and writers

of a D&D game. Games stagnate when the story

meanders too long without a change in  tone, when the

same villains and similar adventures grow tiresome and

predictable, and when the world doesn't change around

the characters and in response to their actions.

World-shaking events force conflict. They set new

events and power groups in motion. Their outcomes

change the world by altering the tone of the setting

in a meaningful way. They chronicle the story of your

world in big, bold print. Change- especially change that

occurs as a result of the characters' actions-keeps the

story moving. If change is imperceptible, the actions

of the characters lack significance. When the world

becomes reliable, it's time to shake things up.

PuTTING EvENTS  IN  MoTION

-------

World-shaking events can happen at any time in

a campaign or story arc, but the biggest incidents

naturally fall at the beginning, middle, and end

of a story.

That placement reflects the structure of dramatic

stories. At the beginning of a story, something happens

to shake the protagonists' world and spur them into

action. The characters take action to resolve their

problems, but other forces oppose them. As they reach a

significant milestone toward their goal, a major conflict

disrupts the characters' plans, shaking their world

again; failure seems imminent. At the end of the story,

they succeed or fail , and the world is shaken again by

the way the characters changed it for good or ill.

At the beginning of a D&D campaign , world-shaking

events create instant adventure hooks and affect the

characters' lives directly. In the middle, they make great

turning points as the characters' fortunes reverse

rising after a defeat or falling after a victory. Near

the end of a campaign, such events serve as excellent

climactic episodes with far-reaching effects. They might

even occur after the story has ended, as a result of the

characters' actions.

WHEN  NoT To  SHAKE  IT UP -----

In constructing a narrative, beware of "false action,"

or action for  its own sake. False action doesn't move

a story forward , engage characters, or cause them to

change. Many action movies suffer from false action, in

which car chases, gunfights , and explosions abound but

do little more than inconvenience the characters and

eventually bore the audience with their repetition and

dearth of meaningful stakes. Some D&D campaigns fall

into the same trap, stringing world-spanning disasters

together one after another with little impact on the

characters or the world. Thus, it's probably not in the

DM's best interest to reorder the world every single time

there's a lull in the action, lest world-shaking events

become ordinary.

As a general rule, a campaign can sustain up to

three large-scale, world-shaking events: one near the

beginning, one near the middle, and one near the

end. Use as many small-scale events that disturb the

bounded microcosms of towns, villages, tribes, fiefs,

duchies, provinces, and so forth as you like. Every

significant event shakes someone's world, after all, no

matter how small that world might be. Let unexpected

a nd terrible events regularly afflict the world's smaller

territories, but unless your story demands it, save the

large-scale map-spanning events for the biggest, most

important moments of your campaign.

Eras are often defined by the prominent leaders,

innovators, and tyrants of th e day. These people change

the world and etch their signatures indelibly on the

pages of history. When they rise to power, they s hape

the time and place where  they live in  monumental ways.

When they fall  from  power or pass away, the ghost of

their presence lingers.

Determine the kind of leader th at influences the new

or passing era. You can choose the type of leader or

Political leaders are monarchs, nobles , and chiefs.

Religious leaders include deities' avatars, high priests ,

and messiahs, as well as those in  cha rge of monasteries

and leaders of influential religious sects. Major military

leaders control the armed forces of countries. They

include military dictators, warlords, and the heads of

a ruler's war council. Minor military leaders include

the heads of local militias, ga ngs, and other martial

organizations. At the broadest scale, a criminal or

underworld leader wields power th rough a  network of

spies, bribes, and black-market trade. On the smallest

scale, these are local gang bosses, pirate captains, and

brigands. A leader in art or culture is a virtuoso whose

work reflects the spirit of the age and changes the way

people think: a prominent playwright, bard, or court fool

in whose words, art, or performance the people perceive

universal truth . On  a smaller scale, this  might be an

influential local poet, minstrel, satirist, or sculptor.

A major leader in philosophy, learning, or magic is

a genius philosopher, a counselor to emperors, an

enlightened thinker, the head of the highest institution

of learning in the world, or an archmage.  A minor leader

CHAPTER 1  I A  WORLD  OF  YOUR  OWN

?..7

might be a local sage, seer, hedge wizard, wise elder,

or teacher.

Rise of a Leader, Beginning of an Era. In dramatic

stories, a new leader's rise often comes at the end of

a period of struggle or turmoil. Sometimes it's a war

or uprising; other times it's an election, the death of a

tyrant, a prophecy fulfilled, or the appointment of a hero.

Conversely, the new leader might be a tyrant, a fiend , or

black-hearted villain, and the era that just ended could

have been one of peace, tranquility, and justice.

A new leader shakes the foundations of your campaign

world and begins a new era in the selected region. How

does this person or this era begin to affect the world?

Here are several things to consider when determining

the leader's impact on the world:

Name one thing that has been consistently true about

the world, which is now no longer true due to this

leader's rise or influence. This is the biggest change

that occurs when the new leader takes power and

becomes the prevailing trait that defines the era, the

characteristic for which it is remembered.

Name the person (or people) whose death, defeat, or

loss opened the door for this leader to  take power.

This might be a  military defeat, the overthrow of

old ideas, a cultural rebirth, or something else. Who

died, lost, or was defeated? What weren't they willing

to compromise? Was the new leader complicit in

the death, defeat, or loss, or was the opportunity

serendipitous?

Despite the leader's virtues, one flaw in particular

outrages a certain segment of the populace. What

is that flaw?  What person or group of persons will

do their utmost to foil  this leader because of it?

Conversely, what is this leader's greatest virtue,  and

who rises to the leader's defense because of it?

Who believes in this leader now,  but still retains

doubts? This is someone close to  the leader, who has

the leader's trust and knows his or her secret fears,

doubts, or vices.

FaJJ of a Leader, End of an Era. All  that begins must

end. With the fall of kings and queens, the maps of the

world are redrawn. Laws change, new customs become

all the rage, and old ones fall out of favor.  The attitude

of the citizens toward their fallen leader shifts subtly at

first and then changes dramatically as they look back or

reminisce about the time before .

The fallen leader might have been a benevolent

ruler, an influential citizen, or even an adversary to the

characters. How does the death of this person affect

those formerly under his or her influence? ijere are

several things to consider when determining the effects

of a leader's passing:

Name one positive change that the leader brought to

his or her domain or sphere of influence. Does that

change persist after the leader's death?

State the general mood or attitude of the people under

this person's power. What important fact didn't they

realize about this person or his or her reign, which

will later come to light?

Name one person or group that tries to fill  the leader's

shoes in the resulting power vacuum.

CHAPTER  1  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR  OWN

Name one person or group that plotted against

this leader.

Name three things for which this leader will be

remembered.

3.  CATACLYSMIC  DISASTER

Earthquake, famin e,  fire, plague, flood- disasters on a

grand scale can eradicate whole civilizations without

warning. Natural (or magical) catastrophes redraw

maps, destroy economies, and alter worlds. Sometimes

the survivors rebuild from  the ruins. The Great Chicago

Fire, for instance, provided a n opportunity to rebuild

the city according to a modern plan. Most of the time

the disaster leaves only ruins- buried under ash like

Pompeii, or s unk beneath the waves like Atlantis.

You  ca n choose the cataclysm or determine one

Some of the disasters on the table might not make

immediate sense in the context of your campaign

world. A flood  in the desert? A volcanic eruption on

grassy plains? If you  randomly determine a disaster

that conflicts with your setting, you can reroll, but the

challenge of justifying the catastrophe can produce

interesting results.

With two exceptions, the disasters on the table

resemble those that affect our own world. Think

of planar warps and magic gone awry like nuclear

incidents; they're big events that unn atu ra lly alter

the land and its people. For example,  in  the Eberron

campa ign setting, a  magical catastrophe lays waste

to an entire country, transforming it into a hostile

wasteland and ending the Las t War.

Divine judgment is something else entirely. This

disaster takes whatever form you want, but it's a lways a

big,  bold, uns ubtle sign of a deity's displeasure.

You  might decide to wipe a town, region, or nation off

the map of your world. A disaster ravages the land and

effectively eliminates a place the characters once knew.

Leave one or two survivors to  tell the characters what

happened , and ensure that the characters feel  the depth

of the catastrophe. What are the ongoing effects of this

cataclysm? The following points can help you define the

nature and consequences of the disaster:

Decide what caused this cataclysm and where it

originated.

An omen presaged this event, or a series of signs and

omens. Describe the omen in detail.

Describe or name the creature that warned the

populace about the oncoming disaster. Who listened?

ho were the lucky (or unlucky) ones who survived?

Describe what the area looks like after the disaster, in

contrast to  how it looked before.

~. ASSAULT OR INVASION

ne of the most common world-shaking events, an

Yasion occurs when one group forcibly takes over

.another, usually by military strength, but also by

.nfi ltration and occupation.

An assault differs from an invasion in that the

acking force  isn't necessarily interested in  occupation

r taking power. On the other hand, an assau lt  might be

e first step of an invasion.

Regardless of the scale, a world-shaking assault or

vasion stands out because its repercussions change

e characters' world, and its effects echo long after the

.nitial attack or takeover.

Imagine that part of your campaign world is attacked

r invaded. Depending on the current scale of your

ampaign, the area might be as small as a section

of a city or as large as a continent, world, or plane of

existence.

Define the aggressor and whether it represents a

..mown enemy or a previously unknown adversary.

determine the aggressor.

Now consider these other aspects of the conflict:

Name one element of the invasion or assault that the 

defenders didn't expect or couldn't repel.

Something happened to the first defenders who stood

against the invasion or assault-something no one

wants to talk about. What was it?

The attackers or invaders had a motive for their

action that wasn't obvious or understood at first.

What was it?

Who turned traitor, and at what point did they turn?

Why did they do it? Did an attacker try to stop the

incursion, or did a prominent defender throw in with

the invaders?

5.  REBELLION,  REVOLUTION,  OVERTHROW

Dissatisfied with the current order, a person or group

of people overturns the dominant regime and takes

over-or fails to take over. Regardless of the result, a

revolution (even an attempted one) can shape the destiny

of nations.

The scale of a revolution need not involve the common

masses against the nobility. A revolution can be as small

as a merchants' guild revolting against its leadership

or a temple overthrowing its priesthood in favor of a

new creed. The spirits of the forest might attempt to

overthrow the forces of civilization in a nearby city that

cut down trees for timber. Alternatively, the scale can be

as dramatic as humanity rising to overthrow the gods.

CHAPTER 1  I A WORLD  OF YOUR  OWN

29

Imagine that part of your campaign world erupts in

revolution. Pick a power group in your current campaign

and name (or invent) a group that opposes it, fomenting

revolution. Then let the following points help you flesh

out the conflict:

Name three things the rebels want or hope to achieve.

The rebels achieve a victory against those they wish

to  overthrow, even if it's a pyrrhic victory. Which of

their three goals do they achieve? How long is this

achievement likely to  last?

State the cost exacted upon the old order after its

fall  from  power. Does anyone from the former power

group remain in  power during the next regime? If the

old order remains in power, describe one way that its

leaders punish the revolutionaries.

One of the rebellion's prominent leaders-in some

respects the face  of the revolution- was driven by a

personal reason for his or her part in events. Describe

this person and state the true reason he or she led the

rebellion.

What problem existed before the revolution that

persists in spite of it?

6. EXTINCTION  OR DEPLETION

Something that once existed in the campaign world

is gone. The lost resource might be a precious metal,

a species of plant or animal that held an important

place in the local ecology, or an entire race or culture of

people. Its absence causes a chain reaction that affects

every creature that uses or relies on  it.

You can eliminate a  people, place, or thing that

previously existed in a certain location or area in your

campaign world. On a small scale, the last of a family

. dynasty passes away or a once-thriving mining town

in the region dries up and becomes a ghost town. On a

grand scale, magic dies, the last dragon is slain, or the

final fey  noble departs the world.

What is gone from the world-or the region of the

world you've chosen- that once existed there? If the

answer isn't immediately evident, consult the Extinction

or Depletion table for ideas.

Then consider these additional questions:

Name a territory, race, or type of creature that relied

on the thing that was lost. How do they compensate?

How do they attempt to substitute for what was lost?

Who or what is to blame for the loss?

Describe an immediate consequence of the loss.

Forecast one way that the loss impacts or changes

the world in the long term. Who or what suffers the

most as a result of the loss? Who or what benefits the

most from it?

7. NEW ORGANIZATION

The foundation of a new order, kingdom, religion,

society, cabal, or cult can shake the world with its

actions, doctrine, dogma, and policies. On a local

scale, a new organization contends with existing power

groups, influencing, subverting, dominating, or allying

with them to create a stronger base of power. Large

and powerful organizations can exert enough influence

to rule the world. Some new organizations benefit the

populace, while others grow to threaten the civilization

they once protected.

Perhaps an important new organization arises in one

part of your world. It could have humble or auspicious

beginnings, but one thing is certain: it is destined to

change the world as long as it progresses along its

present course. Sometimes an organization's alignment

is apparent from inception, but its morality can remain

ambiguous until its doctrines, policies, and traditions

are revealed over time. Choose the type of organization,

or use the New Organizations table to generate ideas.

Then consider some or all of the following options:

The new order supplants a current power group in

the world, gaining territory, converts, or defectors and

reducing the previous power group's numbers. Who or

what does the foundation of this new order supplant?

The new order appeals to a specific audience. Decide

whether this order attracts a certain race, social class,

or character class.

The leader of this new order is known for a particular

quality valued by his or her followers.  Elaborate on

why they respect him or her for this quality, and

what actions this leader has taken to  retain the

followers' support.

A rival group opposes the foundation of this new

organization. Choose an existing power group from

your campaign to oppose the new organization, or

create one from the categories on the table. Decide

why they oppose the new group, who leads them, and

what they plan to  do to stop their rival.

8. DISCOVERY,  EXPANSION ,  INVENTION

Discoveries of new lands expand the map and change

the boundaries of empires. Discoveries of new magic

or technology expand the boundaries of what was once

thought possible. New resources or archaeological finds

create opportunity and wealth and set prospectors and

power groups in motion to vie for their control.

A new discovery-or rediscovery-can impact your

campaign world in a meaningful way, shaping the

course of history and the events of the age. Think of this

discovery as a big adventure hook or series of hooks.

This is also an opportunity to  create a unique monster,

item, god, plane, or race for your world. As long as the

discovery matters, it doesn't have to  be wholly original,

just flavored for your campaign.

A discovery is particularly impressive when the

adventurers in your campaign are the ones who

make it.  If they discover a new mineral with magical

properties, map a new land that's eminently suitable

for colonization, or uncover an ancient weapon with

the power to wreak devastation on your world, they

are likely to set major events in motion. This gives

the players the opportunity to see exactly how much

influence their actions have on your world.

Decide on the type of discovery that is made or use

the Discoveries table to generate ideas.

Once you have determined the type of discovery, flesh

it out by deciding exactly what it  is, who discovered

it, and what potential effect it could  have on the

world. Ideally, previous adventures in your campaign

will help you fill  in the blanks, but also keep the

following in mind:

This discovery benefits a particular person, group, or

faction more than others. Who benefits most? Name

three benefits they stand to  gain from this discovery.

This discovery directly harms another person, group,

or faction. Who is harmed the most?

This discovery has consequences. Name three

repercussions or side effects. Who ignores the

repercussions?

Name two or three individuals or factions struggling

to possess or control this discovery. Who is likely to

win? What do they stand to gain , and what are they

willing to do to control the discovery?

CHAPTER l  I A  WORLD  OF  YOUR OWN

9. PREDICTION'  OMEN'  PROPHECY

Sometimes the foretelling of a world-shaking event

becomes a world-shaking event: an omen that predicts

the fall of empires, the doom of races, and the end

of the world. Sometimes an omen points to change

for  the good, such as the arrival of a legendary hero

or savior. But the most dramatic prophecies warn of

future tragedies and predict dark ages. Unlike other

world-shaking events, the outcome doesn't happen

immediately. Instead, individuals or factions strive to

fulfill  or avert the prophecy-or shape the exact way it

will be fulfilled- according to how it will affect them.

The prophecy's helpers or hinderers create adventure

hooks in the campaign by the actions they take. A

prophecy should foretell a big event on a grand scale,

since it will take time to  come true (or be averted).

Imagine that a world-shaking prophecy comes to  light.

If events continue on their present course, the prophecy

will come true and the world will change dramatically

as a result. Don't shy away from  making this prophecy

both significant and alarming, keeping in mind the

following points:

Create a prophecy that foretells a major change to

the campaign world. You can build one from scratch

using ideas from the current campaign or randomly

determine a world-shaking event and fl~sh out

the details.

Write a list of three or more omens that will  occur

before the prophecy comes to pass. You  can use

events that have already occurred in the campaign so

that the prophecy is closer to being fulfilled . The rest

are events that might or might not happen, depending

on the actions of the characters.

Describe the person or creature that discovered

the prophecy and how it was found. What did  this

creature gain by revealing it? What did this person

lose or sacrifice?

Describe the individual or faction that supports the

prophecy and works to ensure its fulfillment, and the

one that will do all in its power to  avert the prophecy.

What is the first step each takes? Who suffers for

their efforts?

One part of the prophecy is wrong. Choose one of the

omens you listed or one of the details you created for

the world-shaking event that the omen predicts. The

chosen omen is false, and if applicable, its opposite is

true instead.

10. MYTH AND  LEGEND

If wars, plagues, discoveries, and the like can be called

regular world-shaking events, mythic events exceed

and surpass them. A mythic event might occur as the

fulfillment of an ancient or long-forgotten prophecy, or it

might be an act of divine intervention.

Once again, your current campaign probably provides

a few ideas for  the shape of this event. If you need

inspiration, roll a d8 on the World-Shaking Events table,

instead of the normal dlO. Address the bullet-point

notes for that disaster, but magnify the result to  the

grandest scale you can imagine.

CHAPTER 1  j  A  WORLD  OF YOUR OWN

The rise or fall  of a leader or era is the death or

birth of a god , or the end of an age or the world. A

cataclysmic disaster is a world-drowning deluge, an ice

age, or a zombie apocalypse. An  assault or invasion is

a world war, a world-spanning demonic incursion, the

awakening of a world-threatening monster, or the final

clash between good and evil. A rebellion dethrones a

god or gods, or raises a new force (such as a demon

lord) to divinity. A new organization is a world-spanning

empire or a pantheon of new gods. A discovery is a

doomsday device or a portal to eldritch dimensions

where world-shattering cosmic horrors dwell.

TRACKING TIME

A calendar lets you record the passage of time in the

campaign. More importantly, it lets you plan ahead for

the critical events that shake up the world. For simple

time tracking, use a calendar for  the current year in

the real world. Pick a date to indicate the start of the

campaign, and make note of the days that adventurers

spend on their travels and various activities. The

calendar tells you when the seasons change and

the lunar cycle. More importantly, you can use your

calendar to  track important festivals and holidays, as

well as key events that shape your campaign.

This method is a good starting point, but the calendar

of your world need not follow a modern calendar. If you

want to customize your calendar with details unique to

your world, consider these types of features.

THE BASICS

A fantasy world's calendar doesn't have to mirror the

modern one, but it can (see "The Calendar of Harptos"

sidebar for an example). Do the weeks of a month have

names? What about specific days of each month, like the

ides, nones, and calends of the Roman calendar?

PHYSICAL CYCLES

Determine when the seasons fall , marked by the

solstices and equinoxes. Do the months correspond

to the phases of the moon (or moons)? Do strange

and magical effects occur at the same time as these

phenomena?

RELIGIOUS  OBSERVANCES

Sprinkle holy days throughout your calendar. Each

significant deity in your world should have at least one

holy day during the year, and some gods' holy days

correspond to celestial phenomena such as new moons

or equinoxes. Holy days reflect the portfolio of a deity (a

god of agriculture is honored in the harvest season) or

significant events in the history of the deity's worship,

such as the birth or death of a holy person, the date of

a god's  manifestation, the accession of the current high

priest, and so on.

Certain holy days are civic events, observed by every

citizen of a town where a god's temple can be found.

Harvest festivals are often celebrations on a grand

scale. Other holy days are important only to  people

particularly devoted to a single deity. Still others are

observed by priests, who perform private rites and

sacrifices inside their temples on certain days or specific

times of day. And some holy days  are local, observed by

dle fa ithful of a specific temple.

Give some thought to how priests and common folk

elebrate holy days. Going into a temple, sitting in a

pew, a nd  listening to a sermon is a  mode of worship

"oreign to most fantasy religions. More commonly,

celebrants offer sacrifices to their gods. The faithful

bri ng animals to the temple to be slaughtered or

urn incense as an offering. The wealthiest citizens

ori ng the largest animals, to flaunt their wealth and

emonstrate their piety. People pour out libations at the

graves of their ancestors. They spend a ll-night vigils in

darkened shrines or enjoy splendid feasts celebrating a

god's bounty.

C IV IC  OBSERVANCES

Holy days provide the majority of the special

celebrations in most calendars, but local or national

:estivals account for many others. The birthday of a

:nonarch, the anniversary of a great victory in a war,

craft  festivals , market days, and similar events all

;>rovide excuses for  local celebrations.

f AN TASTIC  EVENTS

ince your setting is a fantasy world and not a mundane

::nedieval society, add in a few events of an obviously

magical nature. For example, perhaps a ghostly castle

appears on a certain hill on the winter solstice every

_ea r,  or every third full  moon fills  lycanthropes with a

particularly strong bloodlust. Also, the thirteenth night

of every month could mark the ghostly wanderings of a

ong-forgotten nomadic tribe.

Extraordinary events, such as the approach of a comet

or a lunar eclipse, make good adventure elements, and

:ou can drop them in your calendar wherever you want.

Your calendar can tell you when there's a full moon for

a lunar eclipse, but you can always fudge the date for a

articular effect.

EN DING A  CAMPAIGN

A campaign's ending should tie up all the threads of

beginning and middle, but you don't have to take a

campaign all the way to 20th level for it to  be satisfying.

.\'rap up the campaign whenever your story reaches its

atural conclusion.

:Make sure you allow space and time near the end

of your campaign for  the characters to finish  up any

personal goals. Their own stories need to  end in

a  atisfying way, just as the campaign story does.

dea lly, some of the characters' individual goals will be

:ulfilled by the ultimate goal of the final  adventure. Give

ha racters with unfinished goals a chance to finish them

before the very end.

Once the campaign has ended, a new one can begin.

f you intend to run a new campaign for the same group

of players, using their previous characters' actions as

r.he basis of legends gives them immediate investment in

dle new setting. Let the new characters experience how

me world has changed because of their old characters.

n the end, though, the new campaign is a new story

ith new protagonists. They shouldn't have to share the

potlight with the heroes of days gone by.

The world  of the  Forgotten  Realms  uses the Calendar of

Harptos,  named after the long-dead wizard who  invented

it.  Each  year of 365 days  is  divided  into twelve  months of

thirty days  each, which  roughly correspond to  months  in  the

real-world  Gregorian calendar.  Each  month  is  di vided  into

three tendays.  Five  special  holidays fall  between the months

and  mark the seasons. Another special  holiday,  Shieldmeet,

is  inserted  into the calendar after  Midwinter every four years,

much  like  leap yea rs  in  the modern Gregorian  calendar.

CHAPTER  l  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR  OWN

33

PLAY STYLE

By building a new world (or adopting an existing one)

and creating the key events that launch your campaign,

you determined what your campaign is about. Next, you

have to  decide how you want to run your campaign.

What's the right way to  run a campaign? That depends

on your play style and the motivations of your players.

Consider your players' tastes, your strengths as a

DM,  table rules (discussed in  part 3), and the type of

game you want to  run. Describe to the players how you

envision the game experience and let them give you

input. The game is theirs, too. Lay that groundwork

early, so your players can make informed choices and

help you maintain the type of game you want to  run.

Consider the following two exaggerated examples of

play style.

HACK AND  SLASH

The adventurers kick in the dungeon door, fight the

monsters, and grab the treasure. This style of play is

straightforward, fun , exciting, and action-oriented. The

players spend relatively little time developing personas

for their characters, roleplaying noncombat situations,

or discussing anything other than the immediate

dangers of the dungeon.

In such a game, the adventurers face clearly evil

monsters and opponents and occasionally meet clearly

good and helpful NPCs. Don't expect the adventurers

to anguish over what to do with prisoners, or to  debate

whether it's right or wrong to invade and wipe out a

bugbear lair. Don't track money or time spent in town.

Once they've completed a task, send the adventurers

back into the action as quickly as possible. Character

motivation need be no more developed than a desire to

kill monsters and acquire treasure.

lMMERSIVE  STORYTELLING

Waterdeep is threatened by political turmoil. The

adventurers must convince the Masked Lords, the city's

secret rulers, to resolve their differences, but can do so

A WORLD  TO  EXPLORE

Much  of a campaign  involves  the adventurers traveling from

place to  place,  exploring the environment, and  learning

about the fantasy world . This exploration can take  place  in

any environment,  including a vast wilderness, a labyrinthine

dungeon, the shadowy  passages of the  Underdark, the

crowded streets of a city,  and the undulating waters of

the sea.  Determining a way around  an  obstacle, finding  a

hidden  object,  investigating a strange feature  of a dungeon ,

deciphering clues,  solving puzzles,  and  bypassing or

disabling traps can  all  be  part of exploration.

Sometimes exploration  is  an  incidental  part of the game.

For instance, you  might gloss over an  unimportant journey

by telling the players that they spend three uneventful  days

on  the road  before moving along to the next  point of interest.

Other times exploration  is  the focus,  a chance to describe

a wondrous  part of the world  or story that increases the

players' feeling of immersion.  Similarly, you  should consider

playing up  exploration  if your  players enjoy solving  puzzles,

finding their way around obstacles,  and  searching dungeon

corridors for  secret doors.

,.

only after both the characters and the lords have come

to terms with their differing outlooks and agendas.

This style of gaming is deep, complex, and challenging.

The focus isn't on combat but on negotiations, political

maneuverings, and character interaction. A whole game

session might pass without a single attack roll.

In this style of game, the NPCs are as complex and

richly detailed as the adventurers, although the focus

lies on motivation and personality, not game statistics.

Expect long digressions from each player about what

his or her character does, and why. Going to a temple to

ask a priest for advice can be as important an encounter

as fighting orcs. (And don't expect the adventurers to

fight  the orcs at all unless they are motivated to do

so.) A character will sometimes take actions against

the player's better judgment, because "that's what the

character would do."

Since combat isn't the focus,  game rules take a back

seat to character development. Ability check modifiers

and skill proficiencies take precedence over combat

bonuses. Feel free to  change or ignore rules to fit  the

players' roleplaying needs, using the advice presented in

part 3 of this book.

SOMETHING  IN BETWEEN

The style of play in most campaigns falls between these

two extremes. There's plenty of action, but the campaign

offers an ongoing storyline and interaction between

characters as well. Players develop their characters'

motivations and relish the chance to prove their skills

in combat. To  maintain the balance, provide a mixture

of roleplaying encounters and combat encounters. Even

in a dungeon setting, you can present NPCs that aren't

meant to be fought but rather helped out, negotiated

with, or just talked to.

Think about your preferred style of play by

considering these questions:

Are you a fan  of realism and gritty consequences, or

are you more focused on making the game seem like

an action movie?

Do you want the game to maintain a sense of medieval

fantasy, or do you want to explore alternate time lines

or modern thinking?

Do you want to maintain a serious tone, or is humor

your goal?

Even if you are serious, is the action lighthearted

or intense?

Is bold action key,  or do the players need to be

thoughtful and cautious?

Do you like to plan thoroughly in advance, or do you

prefer improvising on the spot?

Is the game full of varied D&D elements, or does it

center on a theme such as horror?

Is the game for all ages, or does it involve

mature themes?

Are you comfortable with moral ambiguity, such as

allowing the characters to explore whether the end

justifies the means? Or are you happier with straight

forward heroic principles, such as justice, sacrifice,

and helping the downtrodden?

CHAPTER  1  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR  OWN

34

CHARACTER NAMES

Part of your campaign style has to do with naming

characters. It's a good idea to establish some ground

rules with your players at the start of a  new campaign.

In a group consisting of Sithis, Travok, Anastrianna ,

and Kairon, the human fighter named Bob II sticks out,

especially when he's identical to Bob I,  who was killed

by kobolds. If everyone takes a lighthearted approach

to names, that's  fine.  If the group would rather take the

characters and their names a little more seriously, urge

Bob's player to come up with a more appropriate name.

Player character names should match each other

in flavor or concept, and they should also match the

flavor of your campaign world-so should the non player

characters' names and place names you create. Travok

and Kairon don't want to undertake a quest for  Lord

Cupcake, visit Gumdrop Island , or take down a crazy

wizard named Ray.

CONTINUING OR

EPISODIC  CAMPAIGNS

The backbone of a campaign is a connected series

of adventures, but you can connect them in two

different ways.

In a continuing campaign, the connected adventures

share a sense of a larger purpose or a recurring

theme (or themes). The adventures might feature

returning villains, grand conspiracies, or a single

mastermind who's ultimately behind every adventure

of the campaign.

A continuing campaign designed with a theme and

a story arc in mind can feel like a great fantasy epic.

The players derive the satisfaction of knowing the

actions they take during one adventure matter in the

next. Plotting and running that kind of campaign can

be demanding on the DM, but the payoff is a great and

memorable story.

An episodic campaign, in contrast, is like a television

show where each week's episode is a self-contained

story that doesn't play into any overarching plot. It

might be built on a premise that explains its nature: the

player characters are adventurers-for-hire, or explorers

venturing into the unknown and facing a string of

unrelated dangers. They might even be archaeologists,

venturing into one ancient ruin after another in search

of artifacts. An episodic game like this lets you create

adventures-or buy published ones- and drop them into

your campaign without worrying about how they fit with

the adventures that came before and follow after.

CAMPAIGN THEME

A theme in a campaign, as in a work of literature,

expresses the deeper meaning of a story and the

fundamental elements of human experience that the

story explores. Your campaign doesn't have to  be a work

of literature, but it can still draw on common themes

that lend a distinctive flavor to its stories. Consider

these examples:

CHAPTER  I  I A WORLD  OF YOUR  OWN

A campaign about confronting the inevitability of

mortality, whether embodied in undead monsters or

expressed through the death of loved ones.

A campaign revolving around an insidious evil,

whether dark gods, monstrous races such as the

yuan-ti , or creatures of unknown realms far removed

from mortal concerns. As  heroes confront this evil ,

they must face the selfish, cold tendencies of their own

kind as well.

A campaign featuring troubled heroes who confront

not only the savagery of the bestial creatures of the

world, but also the beast within- the rage and fury

that lies in their own hearts.

A campaign exploring the insatiable thirst for  power

and domination, whether embodied by the hosts of the

Nine Hells or by humanoid rulers bent on conquering

the world.

With a theme such as "confrontation with mortality,"

you can craft a broad range of adventures that aren't

necessarily connected by a common villain. One

adventure might feature the dead bursting from  their

graves and threatening to overwhelm a whole town.

In the next adventure, a mad wizard creates a flesh

golem in an effort to  revive his lost love. A villain could

go to extreme lengths to achieve immortality to avoid

confronting its own demise. The adventurers might

help a ghost accept death and move on, or one of the

adventurers might even become a ghost!

VARIATIONS  ON  A  THEME

Mixing things up once in a while allows your players

to  enjoy a variety of adventures. Even a tightly themed

campaign can stray now and then. If your campaign

heavily involves intrigue, mystery, and roleplaying, your

players might enjoy the occasional dungeon crawl

especially if the tangent is revealed to  relate to  a larger

plot irr the campaign. If most of your adventures are

dungeon expeditions, shift gears with a tense urban

mystery that eventually leads the party into a dungeon

crawl in an abandoned building or tower. If you run

horror adventures week after week, try using a villain

who turns out to be ordinary, perhaps even silly. Comic

relief is a great variation on almost any D&D campaign,

though players usually provide it themselves.

TIERS  OF  PLAY

As characters grow in power, their ability to change the

world around them grows with them. It helps to think

ahead when creating your campaign to account for this

change. As the characters make a greater impact on the

world, they face greater danger whether they want to

or not. Powerful factions see them as a threat and plot

against them, while friendly ones court their favor in

hopes of striking a useful alliance.

The tiers of play represent the ideal milestones for

introducing new world-shaking events to  the campaign.

As the characters resolve one event, a new danger

arises or the prior trouble transforms into a new threat

in  response to the characters' actions. Events.need to

grow in magnitude and scope, increasing the stakes and

drama as the characters become increasingly powerful.

This approach also allows you to break your design

work down into smaller pieces. Create material such

as adventures, NPCs, maps, and so on for one tier at

a time. You only need to worry about the details of the

next tier as the characters approach it.  Even better, as

the campaign takes unexpected turns in response to the

players' choices, you don't have to worry about redoing

much work.

LEVELS  1- 4:  LOCAL HEROES

Characters in this tier are still learning the range of

class features that define them, including their choice

of specialization. But even 1st-level characters are

heroes, set apart from the common people by natural

characteristics, learned skills, and the hint of a greater

destiny that lies before them.

At the start of their careers, characters use 1st-

a nd 2nd-level spells and wield mundane gear. The

magic items they find  include common consumable

items (potions and scrolls) and a very few uncommon

permanent items. Their magic can have a big impact in

a single encounter, but it doesn't change the course of an

adventure.

The fate of a village might hang on the success or

failure of low-level adventurers, who trust their lives

to their fledgling abilities. These characters navigate

dangerous terrain and explore haunted crypts, where

they can expect to fight savage orcs, ferocious wolves,

giant spiders, evil cultists, bloodthirsty ghouls, and

hired thugs. If they face even a young dragon, they're

better off avoiding a fight.

LEVELS  5-10:  HEROES  OF THE  REALM

By the time they reach this tier, adventurers have

mastered the basics of their class features , though they

continue to improve throughout these levels. They have

found their place in the world and have begun to involve

themselves in the dangers that surround them.

Dedicated spellcasters learn 3rd-level spells at the

s tart of this tier. Suddenly characters can fly,  damage

large numbers of foes with fireball and lightning bolt

pells, and even breathe underwater. They master

5th-level spells by the end of the tier, and spells such

as  teleportation circle, scrying, flame strike, legend

lore , and raise dead can have a significant impact on

their adventures. They start acquiring more permanent

magic items (uncommon and rare ones) as well, which

will serve them for  the rest of their careers.

The fate of a region might depend on the adventures

that characters of levels 5 to  10 undertake. These

adventurers venture into fearsome wilds and ancient

ruins, where they confront savage giants, ferocious

hydras, fearless golems, evil yuan-ti, scheming devils,

bloodthirsty demons, crafty mind flayers , and drow

assassins. They might have a chance of defeating a

young dragon that has established a lair but not yet

extended its reach far into the surrounding territory.

LEVELS  11-16:  MASTERS  OF THE

REALM

By 11th level, characters are shining examples of

courage and determination-true paragons in the world,

set well apart from the masses. At this tier, adventurers

are far more versatile than they were at lower levels, and

they can usually find the right tool for a given challenge.

Dedicated spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells

at 11th level, including spells that completely change

the way adventurers interact with the world. Their big,

flashy spells are significant in combat- disintegrate ,

blade barrier, and heal, for example- but behind-the

scenes spells such as word of recall, find the path,

contingency, teleport, and true seeing alter the way

players approach their adventures. Each spell level after

that point introduces new effects with an equally large

impact. The adventurers find rare magic items (and very

rare ones) that bestow similarly powerful abilities.

The fate  of a nation or even the world depends on

momentous quests that such characters undertake.

Adventurers explore uncharted regions and delve into

long-forgotten dungeons, where they confront terrible

masterminds of the lower planes, cunning rakshasas

and beholders, and hungry purple worms. They might

encounter and even defeat a powerful adult dragon

that has established a lair and a significant presence in

the world.

At  this tier, adventurers make their mark on the

world in a variety of ways, from the consequences of

their adventures to the manner in which they spend

their hard-won treasure and exploit their well-deserved

reputations. Characters of this level construct fortresses

on land deeded them by local rulers. They found guilds,

temples, or martial orders. They take on apprentices

or students of their own. They broker peace between

nations or lead them into war. And their formidable

reputations attract the attention of very powerful foes.

LEVELS  17-20:  MASTERS  OF  THE

WORLD

By 17th level, characters have superheroic capabilities,

and their deeds and adventures are the stuff of legend.

Ordinary people can hardly dream of such heights of

power-or such terrible dangers.

Dedicated spellcasters at this tier wield earthshaking

9th-level spells such as wish , gate , storm of vengeance ,

and astral projection.  Characters have several rare

and very rare magic items at their disposal, and begin

discovering legendary items such as a vorpal sword or a

staff of the magi.

Adventures at these levels have far-reaching

consequences, possibly determining the fate of

millions in the Material Plane and even places beyond.

Characters traverse otherworldly realms and explore

demiplanes and other extraplanar locales, where they

fight savage bator demons, titans, archdevils, lich

archmages, and even avatars of the gods themselves.

The dragons they encounter are wyrms of tremendous

power, whose sleep troubles kingdoms and whose

waking threatens existence itself.

CHAPTER  l  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR OWN

37

Characters who reach 20th level have attained

the pinnacle of mortal achievement. Their deeds are

recorded in  the annals of history and recounted by

bards for centuries. Their ultimate destinies come to

pass. A cleric might be taken up into the heavens to

serve as a god's right hand. A warlock could become

a patron to  other warlocks. Perhaps a wizard unlocks

the secret to immortality (or undeath) and spends eons

exploring the farthest reaches of the multiverse. A druid

might become one with the land , transforming into a

nature spirit of a particular place or an aspect of the

wild. Other characters could found clans or dynasties

that revere the memory of their honored ancestors

from generation to generation, create masterpieces of

epic literature that are sung and retold for  thousands

of years, or establish guilds or orders that keep the

adventurers' principles and dreams alive.

Reaching this point doesn't necessarily dictate the

end of the campaign. These powerful characters might

be called on to  undertake grand adventures on the

cosmic stage. And as a result of these adventures, their

capabilities can continue to evolve. Characters gain no

more levels at this point, but they can still advance in

meaningful ways and continue performing epic deeds

that resound throughout the multiverse. Chapter 7

details epic boons you can use as rewards for these

characters to maintain a sense of progress.

STARTING AT  HIGHER LEVEL -----

Experienced players familiar with the capabilities of

the character classes and impatient for more significant

adventures might welcome the idea of starting a

campaign with characters above 1st level.  Creating a

higher-level  character uses the same character creation

steps outlined in the Player's Handbook.  Such a

character has more hit points, class features, and spells,

and probably starts with better equipment.

Starting equipment for characters above 1st level is

entirely at your discretion, since you give out treasure

at your own pace. That said , you can use the Starting

Equipment table as a guide.

FLAVORS  OF  FANTASY

DUNGEONS  & DRAGONS  is a fantasy game, but that broad

category encompasses a lot of variety. Many different

flavors of fantasy exist in fiction and film.  Do you want

a  horrific campaign inspired by the works of H. P.

Lovecraft or Clark Ashton Smith? Or do you envision a

world of muscled barbarians and nimble thieves, along

the lines of the classic sword-and-sorcery books by

Robert E. Howard and Fritz Leiber? Your choice can

have a impact on the flavor of your campaign.

HEROIC  FANTASY

~~------------------

Heroic fantasy is the baseline assumed by the D&D

rules. The Player's Handbook describes this baseline:

a multitude of humanoid races coexist with huma ns in

fantasti c worlds. Adventurers bring magical powers to

bear against the monstrous threats they face.  These

characters typically come from ordinary backgrounds,

but something impels them into an adventuring life. The

adventurers are the "heroes" of the campaign, but they

might not be truly heroic, instead pursuing this life for

selfish reasons. Technology and society are based on

medieval norms, though the culture isn't necessarily

European. Campaigns often revolve around delving into

ancient dungeons in search of treasure or in an effort  to

destroy monsters or villains.

This genre is also common in fantasy fiction.  Most

novels set in the Forgotten Realms are best described as

heroic fantasy, following in the footsteps of many of the

authors listed in appendix E of the Player 's  Handbook.

SwoRD AND  SoRCERY

A grim , hulking fighter disembowels the high priest

of the serpent god on his own altar. A laughing rogue

spends ill-gotten gains on cheap wine in filthy taverns.

Hardy adventurers venture into the unexplored jungle in

search of the fabled City of Golden Masks.

A sword-and-sorcery campaign emulates some of the

classic works of fantasy fiction , a tradition that goes

back to the roots of the game. Here you'll find  a dark,

gritty world of evil sorcerers and decadent cities, where

e protagonists are motivated more by greed and self

rerest than by altruistic virtue. Fighter, rogue, and

:Jarbarian characters tend to be far more common than

izards, clerics, or paladins. In such a pulp fantasy

:  rti ng, those who wield magic often symbolize the

:.ecadence and corruption of civilization, and wizards

e the classic villains of these settings. Magic items are

erefore  rare and often dangerous.

Certain DUNGEONS  & DRAGONS  novels follow in the



tsteps of classic sword-and-sorcery novels. The world

:  rcerer-kings, belongs squarely in this genre.

e evil  that threatens the world. And the stories of

e  e campaigns often include an element of romance:

;agic affairs between star-crossed lovers, passion that

:anscends even death, and chaste adoration between



out knights and the monarchs and nobles they serve.

The novels of the Dragon lance saga exemplify the

uch a campaign can draw on the myths and legends

c any culture, not just the familiar Greek tales.

DARK FANTASY

MYSTERY

Vampires brood on the battlements of their accursed

castles. Necromancers toil in dark dungeons to create

horrid servants made of dead flesh.  Devils corrupt the

innocent, and werewolves prowl the night. All of these

elements evoke horrific aspects of the fantasy genre.

If you want to  put a horror spin on your campaign,

you have plenty of material to work with. The Monster

Manual is full of creatures that perfectly suit a storyline

of supernatural horror. The most important element of

such a campaign, though, isn't covered by the rules. A

dark-fantasy setting requires an atmosphere of building

dread, created through careful pacing and evocative

description. Your players contribute too; they have to

be willing to embrace the mood you're trying to  evoke.

Whether you want to run a full-fledged dark-fantasy

campaign or a single creepy adventure, you should

discuss your plans with the players ahead of time to

make sure they're on board. Horror can be intense

and personal, and not everyone is comfortable with

such a game.

Novels and game products set in Ravenloft, the

Demiplane of Dread, explore dark-fantasy elements in a

D&D context.

INTRIGUE

The corrupt vizier schemes with the baron's  oldest

daughter to assassinate the baron. A hobgoblin army

sends doppelganger spies to infiltrate the city before the

invasion. At the embassy ball, the spy in the royal court

makes contact with his employer.

Political intrigue, espionage, sabotage, and similar

cloak-and-dagger activities can provide the basis for

an exciting D&D campaign. In this kind of game, the

characters might care more about skill training and

making contacts than about attack spells and magic

weapons. Roleplaying and social interaction take on

greater importance than combat, and the party might go

for several sessions without seeing a monster.

Again, make sure your players know ahead of time

that you want to run this kind of campaign. Otherwise,

a player might create a defense-focused dwarf paladin,

only to find  he is out of place among half-elf diplomats

and tiefling spies.

The Brimstone Angels novels by Erin M.  Evans focus

on intrigue in the Forgotten Realms setting, from the

backstabbing politics of the Nine Hells to the contested

s_uccession of Cormyrean royalty.

Who stole three legendary magic weapons and hid them

away in a  remote dungeon, leaving a cryptic clue to their

location? Who placed the duke into a magical slumber,

and what can be done to awaken him? Who murdered

the guildmaster, and how did the killer get into the

guild's locked vault?

A mystery-themed campaign puts the characters in

the role of investigators, perhaps traveling from town

to  town to  crack tough cases the local authorities can't

handle. Such a campaign emphasizes puzzles and

problem-solving in addition to combat prowess.

A larger mystery might even set the stage for the

whole campaign. Why did someone kill the characters'

mentor, setting them on the path of adventure? Who

really controls the Cult of the Red Hand? In this case,

the characters might uncover clues to the greater

mystery only once in a while; individual adventures

might be at best tangentially related to  that theme. A

diet of nothing but puzzles can become frustrating, so

be sure to mix up the kinds of encounters you present.

Novels in various D&D settings have explored the

mystery genre with a fantasy twist. In particular, Murder

in Cormyr (by Chet Williamson), Murder in Halruaa (by

Richard S. Meyers), and Spellstorm (by Ed Greenwood)

are mysteries set in the Forgotten Realms. Murder

in  Tarsis (by John Maddox Roberts) takes the same

approach in the Dragonlance setting.

SWASHBUCKLING

Rapier-wielding sailors fight off boarding sahuagin.

Ghouls lurk in derelict ships, waiting to  devour treasure

hunters. Dashing rogues and charming paladins weave

their way through palace intrigues and leap from

balconies onto waiting horses below.

The swashbuckling adventures of pirates and

musketeers suggest opportunities for a dynamic

campaign. The characters typically spend more

time in cities, royal courts, and seafaring vessels

than in dungeon delves, making interaction skills

important (though not to the extent of a pure intrigue

campaign). Nevertheless, the heroes might end up in

classic dungeon situations, such as searching storm

sewers beneath the palace to  find  the evil duke's

hidden chambers.

A good example of a swashbuckling rogue in the

Forgotten Realms is Jack Ravenwild, who appears in

novels by Richard Baker (City of Ravens and Prince

of Ravens).

WAR

A hobgoblin army marches toward the city, leading

elephants and giants to  batter down the stronghold's

walls and ramparts. Dragons wheel above a barbarian

horde, scattering enemies as the raging warriors

cut a swath through field  and forest. Salamanders

muster at an efreeti's command, poised to assault an

astral fortress .

CROSSING THE  STREAMS

The renowned paladin Murlynd, from  the world of

Oerth (as featured in Greyhawk novels and game

products), dresses in the traditional garb of Earth's

Old West and wears a pair of six-shooters strapped

to  his waist. The Mace of St. Cuthbert, a holy weapon

belonging to  Greyhawk's god of justice, found its way

to  the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in  1985.

Somewhere in the Barrier Peaks of Oerth, the wreckage

of a spacefaring vessel is said to lie, with bizarre alien

lifeforms and strange items of technology on board . And

the famous wizard Elminster of the Forgotten Realms

has been said to make occasional appearances in the

kitchen of Canadian writer Ed Greenwood- where he is

sometimes joined by wizards from the worlds of Oerth

an,d Krynn (homeworld of the Dragon lance saga).

Deep in D&D's roots are elements of science

fiction and science fantasy, and your campaign might

draw on those sources as well. It's okay to send your

characters hurtling through a magic mirror to Lewis

Carroll's Wonderland, put them aboard a ship traveling

between the stars, or set your campaign in a far-future

world where laser blasters and magic missiles exist

side by side. The possibilities are limitless. Chapter

9, "Dungeon Master's Workshop," provides tools for

exploring those possibilities.

lHEN ADVENTURERS RE ACH HIGHER LE VELS ,

their path extends to other dimensions of

reality: the planes of existence that form  the

multiverse. The characters might be called

on to rescue a friend from  the horrific depths

of the Abyss or to sail the shining waters of

the River Oceanus. They can hoist a tankard

lhe friendly giants ofYsgard or face the chaos of

bo to contact a wizened githzerai sage.

or test their mettle on a battlefield where the fallen

;-e  urrected with each dawn.

:  :arious planes of existence are realms of myth

mystery.  They're not simply other worlds, but

ensions formed and governed by spiritual and

~  ental principles.

e Outer Planes are realms of spirituality and

ght. They are the spheres where celestials, fiends,

dei ties exist. The plane of Elysium , for example,

merely a place where good creatures dwell, and not

imply the place where spirits of good creatures

. hen they die. It is the plane of goodness, a spiritual

where evil can't flourish. It is as much a state of



a a nd of mind as it  is a physical location.

e Inner Planes exemplify the physical essence

elemental nature of air, earth, fire , and water.

- Elemental Plane of Fire, for example, embodies

~ e  ence of fire. The plane's entire substance is

=  ed with the fundamental nature of fire:  energy,

-on,  transformation, and destruction. Even objects

:  lid brass or basalt seem to dance with flame , in a

ilile and palpable manifestation of the vibrancy of

do minion.

lhis context, the Material Plane is the nexus where

ese philosophical and elemental forces collide in

:umbled existence of mortal life and matter. The

d  of D&D exist within the Material Plane, making

e starting point for most campaigns and adventures.

-e rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to  the

.,-eria l Plane.

l: ..... A. NAR  CATEGORIES

-e planes of the default D&D cosmology are grouped

-:he following categories:

e Material Plane and Its Echoes. The Feywild and

  e Shadowfell are reflections of the Material Plane.

e Transitive Planes. The Ethereal Plane and the

.   tral Plane are mostly featureless planes that

:  rve primarily as pathways to  travel from one plane

o another.

The Inner Planes. The four Elemental Planes (Air,

Earth, Fire, and Water),  plus the Elemental Chaos that

surrounds them, are the  Inner Planes.

The Outer Planes. Sixteen Outer Planes correspond

to  the eight non-neutral alignments and shades of

philosophical difference between them .

The Positive and Negative Planes. These two planes

enfold the rest of the cosmology, providing the raw

forces  of life and death that underlie the rest of

existence in the multiverse.

PUTTING THE  PLANES TOGETHER

As described in  the Player's Handbook, the assumed

D&D cosmology includes more than two dozen planes.

For your campaign, you decide what planes to include,

inspired by the standard planes, drawn from  Earth's

myths, or created by your own imagination.

At  minimum , most D&D campaigns require

these elements:

A pl a ne of origin for fiends

A plane of origin for  celestials

A plane of origin for elementals

A place for deities, which might include any or all of

the previous three

The place where mortal spirits go  after death, which

might include any or all  of the first three

A way of getting from one plane to another

A way for spells and monsters that use the Astral

Plane and the Ethereal Plane to function

Once you've  decided on the planes you want to  use in

your campaign , putting them into a coherent cosmology

is an optional step. Since the primary way of traveling

from  plane to  plane, even using the Transitive Planes,

is through magical portals that link planes together, the

exact relationship of different planes to one another is

largely a theoretical concern. No  being in the multiverse

can look down and see the planes in  their arrangement

the same way as we look at a diagram in a book. No

mortal can verify whether Mount Celestia is sandwiched

between Bytopia and Arcadia, but it's a convenient

theoretical construct based on the philosophical

shading among the three planes and the relative

importance they give to law and good.

Sages have constructed a few such theoretical models

to make sense of the jumble of planes, particularly the

Outer Planes. The three most common are the Great

INVENTING  YOUR  OWN  PLANES

Each  of the planes described  in  this chapter has at least

one significant effect on travelers who venture there. When

you  design your own  planes,  it's  a good  idea to stick to

that model. Create one simple trait that players  notice, that

doesn't create too much complication  at the gaming table,

and that's easy to remember. Try  to reflect the philosophy and

mood of the place, not merely  its  physical  characteristics .

Wheel, the World Tree, and the World Axis , but you

can create or adapt whatever model works best for the

planes you want to use in your game.

THE  GREAT WHEEL

The default cosmological arrangement presented

in the Player's Handbook visualizes the planes as a

group of concentric wheels, with the Material Plane

and its echoes at the center. The Inner Planes form

a wheel around the Material Plane, enveloped in  the

Ethereal Plane. Then the Outer Planes form another

wheel around and behind (or above or below) that one,

arranged according to alignment, with the Outlands

linking them all.

This arrangement makes sense of the way the River

Styx flows among the Lower Planes, connecting

Acheron, the Nine Hells, Gehenna, Hades, Carceri, the

Abyss, and Pandemonium like beads on a string. But it's

not the only possible explanation of the river's course.

THE WORLD TREE

A different arrangement of planes envisions them

situated among the roots and branches of a great cosmic

tree, literally or figuratively.

For example, the Norse cosmology centers on the

World Tree Yggdrasil. The three roots of the World

Tree touch the three realms: Asgard (an Outer Plane

that includes Valhalla, Vanaheim, Alfheim, and other

regions), Midgard (the Material Plane), and Niflheim

(the underworld). The Bifrost, the rainbow bridge,

is a unique transitive plane that connects Asgard

and Midgard.

Similarly, one vision of the planes where the deities

of the Forgotten Realms reside situates a number of

celestial planes in the branches of a World Tree, while

the fiendish planes are linked by a River of Blood.

Neutral planes stand apart from them. Each of these

planes is primarily the domain of one or more deities,

though they are also the homes of celestial and fiendish

creatures.

THE WORLD AxiS

In this view of the cosmos, the Material Plane and its

echoes stand between two opposing realms. The Astral

Plane (or Astral Sea) floats above them, holding any

number of divine domains (the Outer Planes). Below

the Material Plane is the Elemental Chaos, a single,

undifferentiated elemental plane where all the elements

clash together. At the bottom of the Elemental Chaos is

the Abyss, like a hole torn in the fabric of the cosmos.

OTHER VISIONS

As you build your own cosmology, consider the

following alternatives.

The Omniverse. This simple cosmology covers the

bare minimum: a Material Plane; the Transitive Planes;

a single Elemental Chaos; an Overheaven, where good

aligned deities and celestials live; and the Underworld,

where evil deities and fiends live.

Myriad Planes. In this cosmology, countless planes

clump together like soap bubbles, intersecting with each

other more or less at random.

CHAPTER  2  I CREATING  A  Mt.:LTI\ ERSE

The Orrery. All  the Inner and Outer Planes orbit the

Material Plane, exerting greater or lesser influence on

the world as they come nearer and farther. The world of

Eberron uses this cosmological model.

The Winding Road. In this cosmology, every plane is

a stop along an infinite road. Each plane is adjacent to

two others, but there's no necessary cohesion between

adjacent planes; a traveler can walk from  the slopes of

Mount Celestia onto the slopes of Gehenna.

Mount Olympus. In the Greek cosmology, Mount

Olympus stands at the center of the world (the Material

Plane), with its peak so high that it's actually another

plane of existence: Olympus, the home of the gods. All

the Greek gods except Hades have their own domains

within Olympus. In Hades, named for its ruler, mortal

souls linger as insubstantial shades until they eventually

fade into nothing. Tartarus, where the titans are

imprisoned in endless darkness, lies below Hades. And

far to the west of the known world in the Material Plane

are the blessed Elysian Fields. The souls of great heroes

reside there.

Solar Barge. The Egyptian cosmology is defined by

the daily path of the sun- across the sky of the Material

Plane, down to the fair Offering Fields in  the west,

where the souls of the righteous live in eternal reward,

and then beneath the world through the nightmarish

Twelve Hours of Night. The Solar Barge is a tiny Outer

Plane in its own right, though it exists within the Astral

Plane and the other Outer Planes in the different stages

of its journey.

One World.  In this model, there are no other

planes of existence, but the Material Plane includes

places like the bottomless Abyss, the shining Mount

Celestia, the strange city of Mechanus, the fortress of

Acheron, and so on. All the planes are locations in the

wodd, reachable by ordinary means of travel-though

extraordinary effort is required, for example, to sail

across the sea to the blessed isles of Elysium.

The Otherworld. In this model, the Material Plane

has a twin realm that fills  the role of all the other planes.

Much like the Feywild, it overlays the Material Plane

and can be reached through "thin places" where the

worlds are particularly close: through caves, by sailing

far across the sea, or in fairy rings in remote forests. It

has dark, evil regions (homes of fiends and evil gods),

sacred isles (homes of celestials and the spirits of the

blessed death), and realms of elemental fury.  This

otherworld is sometimes overseen by an eternal city, or

by four cities that each represent a different aspect of

reality. The Celtic cosmology has an otherworld , called

Tfr na n6g, and the cosmologies of some religions

inspired by Asian myth have a similar Spirit World.

PLANAR TRAVEL

When adventurers travel to other planes of existence,

they undertake a legendary journey that might force

them to face supernatural guardians and undergo

various ordeals. The nature of that journey and the trials

along the way depend in part on the means of travel, and

whether the adventurers find  a magic portal or use a

spell to carry them.

Random. A random portal functions for a random

Command Word. The portal functions only if a

particular command word is spoken.  Sometimes the

word must be spoken as a character passes through

the portal (which is otherwise a mundane doorway,

window, or similar opening). Other portals open when

the command word is spoken and remain open for a

short time.

Key. The portal functions if the traveler is holding a

particular object; the item acts much like a key to

ll.  door. This key item can be a common object or a

particular key created for  that portal. The city of Sigil

above the Outlands is known as the City of Doors

because it features an overwhelming number of such

item-keyed portals.

Learning and meeting a portal's requirements can

SPELLS

Sa~ya raised her hands and began to declaim  the words of

a very powerful spell, one of the most dangerous she knew,

a spell designed to breach the barriers between the planes

and create a magical bridge into another realm  of existence.

The  myth a/ thrummed in  response, th e intangible pulse of

the old device taking on a new and different note. Sarya

ignored the myth a/ stone's change and pressed on, finishing

her gate spell with skill and confidence.

"The gate is open!" she cried.  "Malkizid, come forth !"

Before Sarya a great ring or hoop of golden magic

coalesced from the air.  Through  it she glimpsed the realm

of Malkizid, an  infernal wasteland of parched desert,

windswept rifts, and black, angry skies torn by crimson

lightning.  Then , through the gate,  the archdevil Malkizid

appeared. With  one smooth step he crossed from his

infernal plane into the myth a/ chamber.

Richard Baker, Farthest Reach

A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to

other planes of existence. Plane shift and gate can

directly transport adventurers to any other plane, with

different degrees of precision. Etherealness allows

adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane. And the astral

projection spell lets adventurers project themselves

into the Astral Plane and from  there travel to the

Outer Planes.

Plane Shift. The plane shift spell has two important

limitations. The first is the material component: a

small, forked , metal rod (like a tuning fork) attuned to

the desired planar destination. The spell requires the

proper resonating frequen cy to home in on the correct

location , and the fork must be made of the right material

(sometimes a complex alloy) to focus the spell's magic

properly. Crafting the fork is expensive (at least 250 gp),

but even the act of researching the correct specifications

can lead to adventure. After all. not ma ny people

voluntarily travel into the depth  of Carceri, so very few

know what kind of tuning fork i  required to get there.

Second, the spell doesn't  end the caster to a specific

location unless he or she ha  pecialized information.

The sigil sequence of a teleponation ci rcle located on

another plane allows the ca  rer ro  travel directly to that

CHAPTER 2  I CREATING A

E

circle, but such knowledge is even harder to come

by tha n the specifications of the required tuning

fork.  Otherwise, the spell transports the caster to

a location in the general vicinity of the desired spot.

Wherever the adventurers arrive, they'll most likely

still need to  undertake a journey to reach the object of a

planar quest.

Gate. The gate spell opens a portal linked to a speci fic

point on another plane of existence. The spell provides

a shortcut to a planar destination, bypassing many of

the guardians and trials that would normally fill  such

a journey. But this 9th-level spell is out of reach for all

but the most powerful characters, and it does nothing to

negate any obstacles that wait at the destination.

The gate spell is powerful , but not infallible. A deity,

demon lord, or other powerful entity can prevent such a

portal from opening within its dominion.

ASTRAL PLANE

Halisstra  opened her eyes and found herself drifting in

an endless silver sea.  Soft gray clouds moved slowly in

the distance, while strange dark streaks twisted violently

through the sky, anchored in  ends so distant she couldn't

perceive th em, their middle parts revolving angrily like

pieces of string rolled between a child 's fingertips.  She

glanced down,  wondering what supported her, and saw

nothing but more of th e strange pearly sky beneath her fee t

and all around her.

She drew in  a sudden breath , surprised by the sight, and

felt her lungs fill  with something sweeter and perhaps a little

more solid than air, but instead of gagging or drowning

on the stuff she seemed perfectly acclimated to it. An

electric thrill raced through her limbs as she found herself

mesmerized by the simple act of respiration.

Richard Baker, Condemna tio

The Astral Plane is the realm of thought and dream ,

where visitors travel as disembodied souls to  reach

the Outer Planes. It is a great silvery sea, the same

above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray

streaking among motes of light like distant stars. Most

of the Astral Sea is a vast, empty expanse. Visitors

occasionally stumble upon the petrified corpse of a

dead god or other chunks of rock drifting forever in the

silvery void.  Much more commonplace are color pools

magical pools of colored light that flicker like radiant,

spinning coins.

Creatures on the Astral Plane don't age or suffer from

hunger or thirst. For this reason, humanoids that live

on the Astral Plane (such as the githyanki) establish

outposts on other planes, often the Material Plane, so

their children can grow to maturity.

A traveler in the Astral Plane can move by simply

thinking about moving, but distance has little meaning.

In combat, though, a creature's walking.speed (in feet) is

equal to 3 x its Intelligence score. The smarter a creature

is, the easier it can control its movement by act of will.

ASTRAL PROJECTION

Traveling through the Astral Plane by means of

the astral projection spell involves projecting one's

consciousness there, usually in search of a gateway to an

Outer Plane to visit. Since the Outer Planes are as much

s piritual states of being as they are physical places, this

allows a character to manifest in an Outer Plane as if he

or she had physically traveled there, but as in a dream.

A character's death-either in the Astral Plane or on

the destination plane-causes no actual harm. Only the

severing of a character's silver cord while on the Astral

Plane (or the death of his or her helpless physical body

on the Material Plane) can result in the character's true

death. Thus, high-level characters sometimes travel to

the Outer Planes by way of astral projection rather than

eek out a portal or use a more direct spell.

Only a few  things can sever a traveler's silver cord, the

most common being a psychic wind (described below).

The legendary silver swords of the githyanki also have

this ability. A character who travels bodily to the Astral

Plane (by means of the plane shift spell or one of the

.-are portals that leads directly there) has no silver cord.

C OLOR POOLS

Gateways leading from the Astral Plane to other

planes appear as two-dimensional pools of rippling

colors, ld6 x 10 feet in diameter. Traveling to another

plane requires locating a color pool that leads to the

desired plane. These gateways to other planes can be

:dentified by color, as shown on the Astral Color Pools

table. Finding the right color pool is a matter of chance:

.ocating the correct one takes ld4 x 10 hours of travel.

PSYCHIC WIND

A psychic wind isn't a physical wind like that found on

the Material Plane, but a storm of thought that batters

travelers' minds rather than their bodies. A psychic

wind is made up of lost memories, forgotten ideas,

minor musings, and subconscious fears that went

astray in the Astral Plane and conglomerated into this

powerful force.

A psychic wind is first sensed as a rapid darkening of

the silver-gray sky. After a few rounds, the area becomes

as dark as a moonless night. As the sky darkens, the

traveler feels buffeting and shaking, as if the plane itself

was rebelling against the storm. As quickly as it comes,

the psychic wind passes, and the sky returns to normal

in a few rounds.

The psychic wind has two kinds of effects: a

location effect and a mental effect. A group of travelers

journeying together suffers the same location effect.

Each traveler affected by the wind must also make a

DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the

traveler suffers the mental effect as well. Roll a d20

twice and consult the Psychic Wind Effects table to

determine the location and mental effects.

ASTRAL PLANE  ENCOUNTERS

Planar travelers and refugees from other planes wander

the expanses of the Astral Plane. The most prominent

denizens of the Astral Plane are the githyanki, an

outcast race of reavers that sail sleek astral ships,

slaughter astral travelers, and raid planes touched

by the AstraL Their city, Tu'narath, floats through the

Astral Plane on a chunk of rock that is actua lly the body

of a dead god.

Celestials, fiends, and mortal explorers often scour

the Astral Plane for color pools leading to desired

destinations. Characters who linger for too long

in the Astral might have an encounte r with one or

more wandering angels, de mons, devils, night hags,

yugoloths, or other planar travelers.

ETHEREAL PLANE

Tamlinfelt a hand on him , felt his body shimmer into

mist The screams and shouts sounded far off- The walls

"The  ethereal plane," Rivalen said.  "The dragon's breath

cannot affect us here."

PaulS. Kemp, Shadowstorm

The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension.

Its "shores," called the Border Ethereal, overlap the

Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every

location on those planes has a corresponding location

on the Ethereal Plane. Visibility in the Border Ethereal

is limited to 60 feet The plane's de pths comprise a

region of swirl ing mist and fog called the Deep EthereaL

where visibility is limited to 30 feet

Characters can use the etherealness spell to  enter

the Border EthereaL The plane shift spell allows

transport to the Border Ethereal or the Deep Ethereal,

but unless the intended destination is a specific location

or a teleportation circle, the point of arrival could  be

anywhere on the plane.

BORDER ETHEREAL ------

From the Border Ethereal , a traveler can see into

whatever plane it overlaps, but that plane appears muted

and indistinct, its colors blurring into each other and

its edges turning fuzzy.  Ethereal denizens watch the

plane as though peering through distorted and frosted

glass, and can't see anything beyond 30 feet into the

other plane. Conversely, the Ethereal Plane is usually

invisible to those on the overlapped planes, except with

the aid of magic.

Normally, creatures in  the Border Ethereal can't

attack creatures on the overlapped plane, a nd vice

versa. A traveler on the Ethereal Plane is invisible and

utterly silent to someone on the overlapped plane, and

solid objects on the overlapped plane don't ha mper

the movement of a creature in the Borde r EthereaL

The exceptions are certain magical effects (including

anything made of magical force)  a nd living beings. This

makes the Ethereal Plane ideal for reconnaissance,

spying on opponents, and moving around without being

detected. The Ethereal Plane also disobeys the laws

of gravity; a creature there can move up and down as

easily as walking.

DEEP ETHEREAL -------

To reach the Deep Ethereal, one needs a plane shift

spell or arrive by means of a gate spell  or magical portaL

Visitors to the Deep Ethereal are engulfed by roiling

mist Scattered throughout the plane are curtains of

vaporous color, and passing through a curtain leads a

traveler to a region of the Border Ethereal connected to

a specific Inner Plane, the Material Plane, the Feywild.

or the ShadowfelL The color of the curtain indicates the

plane whose Border Ethereal the curtain conceals; see

the Ethereal Curtains  table.

Traveling through the Deep Ethereal to journey from

one plane to another is unlike physical travel. Distance

is meaningless, so although travelers feel  as if they can

move by a simple act of will, it's impossible to measure

speed and hard to track the passage of time. A trip

between planes through the Deep Ethereal takes 1d10

x 10 hours, regardless of the origin and destination. In

combat, however, creatures are considered to move at

their normal speeds.

ETHER  CYCLONES

An ether cyclone is a serpentine column that spins

through the plane. The cyclone appears abruptly,

distorting and uprooting ethereal forms in its path and

carrying the debris for leagues. Travelers with a  passive

Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or more receive 1d4

rounds of warning: a deep hum in the ethereal matter.

Travelers who can't reach a curtain or portal leading

elsewhere suffer the cyclone's effect. Roll a d20 and

consult the Ether Cyclone table to  determine the effect

on all creatures in the vicinity.

The most common effect of an ether cyclone is to

extend the duration of a journey. Each character in a

group traveling together must make a DC 15 Charisma

aving throw. If at least half the group succeeds, travel

is delayed by  1d10 hours. Otherwise, the journey's travel

time is doubled. Less often, a  group is blown into the

Border Ethereal of a random plane. Rarely, the cyclone

rears a hole in the fabric of the plane and hurls the party

into the Astral Plane.

E THEREAL PLANE  ENCOUNTERS

_lost encounters in the Border Ethereal are with

eatures on the Material Plane whose senses or

abilities extend into the Ethereal Plane (phase spiders,

:or example). Ghosts also move freely between the

:=:rhereal and Material Planes.

In the Deep Ethereal, most encounters are with other

~velers ,  particularly ones from the Inner Planes (such

...: elementals, genies, and salamanders), as well as the

casional celestial, fiend , or fey.

FEYWILD

Stepping into the portal was like settling into a warm  bath,

though the chill didn't jade from the air. At first everything

muted-the roar of the river around the rocks below, the

ch irp ing of frogs and crickets on shore, the evening bustle of

th e town behind him . ... A moment later,  the world erupted

into vibrant life.  Frogs and night birds sang a chorus; the air

was awash with autumn scents; the moonlight painted the

flo wers in  iridescent blue, silver, and violet; and the rushing

of th e river became a complex symphony.

James Wyatt, Oath of Vigilance

The Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie, is a land of

soft lights and wonder, a place of music and death. It is a

realm of everlasting twilight, with glittering faerie lights

bobbing in the gentle breeze and fat fireflies buzzing

through groves and fields. The sky is alight with the

faded colors of an ever-setting sun, which never truly

sets (or rises for that matter); it remains stationary,

dusky and low in the sky. Away from the settled areas

ruled by the seelie fey  that compose the Summer Court,

the land is a tangle of sharp-toothed brambles and

syrupy fens- perfect territory for  the unseelie fey  to  hunt

their prey.

The Feywild exists in parallel to the Material

Plane, an alternate dimension that occupies the same

cosmological space. The landscape of the Feywild

mirrors the natural world but turns its features into

spectacular forms. Where a volcano stands on the

Material Plane, a mountain topped with skyscraper

sized crystals that glow with internal fire  towers in the

Feywild. A wide and muddy river on the Material Plane

might be echoed as a clear and winding brook of great

beauty. A marsh could be reflected as a vast black bog of

sinister character. And moving to the Feywild from old

ruins on the Material Plane might put a traveler at the

door of an arch fey's castle.

The Feywild is inhabited by sylvan creatures, such

as elves, dryads, satyrs, pixies, and sprites, as well as

centaurs and magical creatures such as blink dogs,

faerie dragons, treants, and unicorns. The darker

regions of the plane are home to such malevolent

creatures as hags, blights, goblins, ogres, and giants.

SEELIE  AND  UNSEELIE  FEY

Two  queens  hold  court in  the  Feywild,  and  most fey  owe

allegiance to one or the other.  Queen Titania  and  her

Summer Court lead the seelie fey,  and the Queen of Air  and

Darkness,  ruler of the Gloaming Court, leads the unseelie fey.

Seelie and  unseelie do  not directly correlate with  good  and

evil,  though  many mortals  make that equation.  Many  seelie

fey  are good,  and  many unseelie are evil,  but their opposition

to each other stems from  their queens' jealous  rivalry,  not

abstract moral  concerns.  Ugly  denizens of the  Feywild,  such

as fomorians and  hags,  are almost never members of either

court,  and  fey of independent spirit  reject the courts entirely.

The courts have warred  at times,  but they also compete in

more-or-less friendly  contests and even  ally  with  one another

in  small and secret ways.

CHAPTER 2  I CREATING  A  MULTIVERSE

49

FEY CROSSINGS

Fey crossings are places of mystery and beauty on the

Material Plane that have a near-perfect mirror in the

Feywild, creating a portal where the two planes touch.

A traveler passes through a fey crossing by entering a

clearing, wading into a pool, stepping into a circle of

mushrooms, or crawling under the trunk of a tree. To

the traveler, it seems like he or she has simply walked

into the Feywild with a step. To an observer, the traveler

is there one moment and gone the next.

Like other portals between planes, most fey crossings

open infrequently. A crossing might open only during

a full moon, on the dawn of a particular day, or for

someone carrying a certain type of item. A fey crossing

can be closed permanently if the land on either side is

dramatically altered- for example, if a castle is built

over the clearing on the Material Plane.

OPTIONAL RULES:  FEYWILD  MAGIC

Tales speak of children kidnapped by fey creatures

and spirited away to the Feywild, only to  return to their

parents years later without having aged a day, and

with no memories of their captors or the realm they

came from. Likewise, adventurers who return from an

excursion to the Feywild are often alarmed to discover

upon their return that time flows differently on the

Plane of Faerie, and that the memories of their visit

are hazy. You can use these optional rules to reflect the

strange magic that suffuses the plane.

MEMORY LOSS

A creature that leaves the Feywild must make a DC

10 Wisdom saving throw. Fey creatures automatically

succeed on the saving throw, as do any creatures, like

elves, that have the Fey Ancestry trait. A creature that

fails the saving throw remembers nothing from its

time spent in the Feywild. On a successful save, the

creature's memories remain intact but are a little hazy.

Any spell that can end a curse can restore the creature's

lost memories.

TIME WARP

While time seems to pass normally in the Feywild,

characters might spend a day there and realize, upon

leaving the plane, that less or more time has elapsed

everywhere else in the multiverse.

Whenever a creature or group of creatures leaves

the Feywild after spending at least 1 day on that plane,

you can choose a time change that works best for your

campaign, if any, or roll on the Feywild Time Warp

table. A wish spell can be used to remove the effect on

up to ten creatures. Some powerful fey  have the ability

to  grant such wishes and might do so if the beneficiaries

and the feeling made him too big by half.

PaulS. Kemp, The Godborn

he Shadowfell, also called the Plane of Shadow, is a

dimension of black, gray, and white where most other

color has been leached from  everything. It is a place of

darkness that hates the light, where the sky is a black

ault with neither sun nor stars.

The Shadowfell overlaps the Material Plane in much

r.be same way as the Feywild. Aside from the colorless

landscape, it appears similar to the Material Plane.

Landmarks from the Material Plane are recognizable

on the Shadowfell, but they are twisted and warped

distorted reflections of what exists on the Material

Plane. Where a mountain stands on the Material Plane,

the corresponding feature on the Shadowfell is a jagged

rock outcropping with a resemblance to  a skull, a heap

of rubble, or perhaps the crumbling ruin of a once-great

castle. A forest on the Shadowfell is dark and twisted,

its branches reaching out to snare travelers' cloaks, and

its roots coiling and buckling to trip those who pass by.

Shadow dragons and undead creatures haunt this

bleak plane, as do other creatures that thrive in the

gloom, including cloakers and darkmantles.

SHADOW  CROSSINGS

Similar to fey crossings, shadow crossings are locations

where the veil between the Material Plane and the

Shadowfell is so thin that creatures can walk from one

plane to  the other. A blot of shadow in the corner of a

dusty crypt might be a shadow crossing, as might an

open grave. Shadow crossings form in gloomy places

where spirits or the stench of death lingers, such as

battlefields, graveyards, and tombs. They manifest only

in darkness, closing as soon as they feel light's kiss.

DOMAINS  OF  DREAD

In remote corners of the Shadowfell, it is easy to reach

horrific demiplanes ruled over by accursed beings of

terrible evil. The best known of these is the valley of

Barovia, overlooked by the towering spires of Castle

Ravenloft and ruled by Count Strahd von Zarovich,

the first vampire. Beings of the Shadowfell called the

Dark Powers created these domains as prisons for

these "darklords,"  and through cruelty or carelessness

trapped innocent mortals in  these domains  as well.

OPTIONAL RULE:

SHADOWFELL DESPAIR

A melancholic atmosphere pervades the Shadowfell.

Extended forays to this plane can afflict characters with

despair, as reflected in this optional rule.

When you deem it appropriate, though usually not

more than once per day, you can require a character

not native to the Shadowfell to make a DC 10 Wisdom

saving throw. On a failure , the character is affected by

despair. Roll a d6 to determine the effects, using the

Shadowfell Despair table. You can substitute different

despair effects of your own creation.

SHADOWFELL  DESPAIR

Effect

Apathy. The character has disadvantage on

death  saving throws and  on  Dexterity checks for

initiative, and  gains the following flaw:  "I  don't

believe  I can  make a difference to anyone or

anything."

Dread. The character has  disadvantage on  all

saving throws and  gains the following flaw: "I  am

convinced that this  place  is  going to kill  me."

Madness. The character has disadvantage

on  ability checks and saving throws that use

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, and  gains the

following flaw:  "I  can't tell  what's  real  anymore."

If a character is already suffering a despair effect and

fails the saving throw, the new despair effect replaces

the old one. After finishing a long rest, a character

can attempt to overcome the despair with a DC 15

Wisdom saving throw. (The DC is higher because it's

harder to shake off despair once it has taken hold.)

On a successful save, the despair effect ends for  that

character.

A calm emotions spell removes despair, as does any

spell or other magical effect that removes a curse.

EVER NIGHT

The city of Neverwinter in  the world  of the  Forgotten  Realms

has a dark  reflection  on the Shadowfell: the city of Evernight.

Evernight is  a city of cracked  stone edifices  and  homes of

rotten wood.  Its  roads are  made mostly of trampled grave

dust, and  its few  cobbled streets are  missing enough stones

that they appear pockmarked. The sky  is  corpse gray, and the

breeze blows cold  and  humid,  bringing a chill  to the skin.

The city's living  residents  include  mad  necromancers ,

corrupt purveyors of human flesh,  worshipers of evil deities,

and others who are able to  make themselves useful  and  crazy

enough to want to live  here. But the living are a minority

in  Evernight,  for the  bulk of the population consists of the

shambling dead. Zombies, wights, vampires , and  other

undead  make the city their home,  all  under the watchful  eyes

of the ruling caste: intelligent, flesh-eating ghouls.

Rumors  abound that this foul  place mirrors one city on

every world.

Thank the fell  ones,  Vhok thought. I never thought I'd be

so happy to be here.

Thomas M.  Reid, Th e Gossamer Plain

The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material

Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental

substance from which all worlds were made. The four

Elemental Planes- Air, Earth, Fire, and Water- form

a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within

a churning realm known as the Elemental Chaos.

These planes are all connected, and the border regions

between them are sometimes described as distinct

planes in their own right.

At their innermost edges, where they are closest

to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal

geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes

resemble places in the Material Plane. The four

elements mingle together as they do in  the Material

Plane, forming land , sea, and sky. But the dominant

element exerts a strong influence on the environment,

reflecting its fundamental qualities.

The inhabitants of this inner ring include aarakocra,

azers, dragon turtles, gargoyles, genies, mephits,

salamanders, and xorn. Some originated on the

Material Plane, and all can travel to the Material

Plane (if they have access to the magic required) and

survive there.

As. they extend farther from  the Material Plane,

the Elemental Planes become increasingly alien and

hostile. Here, in the outermost regions, the elements

exist in their purest form:  great expanses of solid earth,

blazing fire , crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. Any

foreig-n  substance is extremely rare; little air can be

found in the outermost reaches of the Plane of Earth,

and earth is all but impossible to  find  in the outermost

reaches of the Plane of Fire. These areas are much less

hospitable to travelers from  the Material Plane than

the border regions are. Such regions are little known,

so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a

speaker usually means the border region.

The outermost regions are largely the domains of

elemental spirits barely recognizable as creatures.

The creatures usually called elementals dwell here,

including the Elemental Princes of Evil (primordial

beings of pure elemental fury) and elemental spirits

that spellcasters can bind into galeb duhrs, golems,

invisible stalkers, magmin, and water weirds. These

elemental creatures don't need food or other sustenance

on their home planes, because they are sustained by the

elemental energies that saturate those planes.

ELEMENTAL CHAOS ----

At the farthest extents of the Elemental Planes, the pure

elements dissolve a nd bleed together into an unending

wt of clashing energies and colliding substance

ed the Elemental Chaos. Elementals can be found

a  well, but they usually don't stay long, preferring

~ .:omfort of their native planes. Reports indicate

~xist e nce of weird hybrid elementals native to the

ental Chaos, but such creatures are seldom seen

er planes.

~A  entia! nature of air is movement, animation, and

At the other end of the plane. near the Frostfell (the

plane of ice that borders the Plane of Water), is a region

of frigid winds called the Mistral Reach. These gales

drive snowstorms into the Frostfell and away from it,

.toward the heart of the plane. Earth motes in the reach

are covered with snow and ice.

PLANE  OF  EARTH

I  Earth symbolizes stability, rigidity, stern resolve, and

tradition. The plane's position opposite the Plane of

Air in the ring of the Elemental Planes reflects its

opposition to almost everything air represents.

The Plane of Earth is a chain of mountains rising

higher than any mountain range in the Material Plane.

It has no sun of its own, and no air surrounds the peaks

of its highest mountains. Most visitors to  the plane

arrive by way of caves and caverns that honeycomb the

mountains.

The largest cavern beneath the mountains, called

the Great Dismal Delve or the Sevenfold Mazework, is

home to  the capital city of the dao, the City of jewels.

The dao take great pride in their wealth and send teams

of slaves across the plane in search of new veins of

ore and gemstones to exploit. Thanks to their efforts,

every building and significant object in the city is made

from  precious stones and metals, including the slender

gemstone-inlaid spires that top most buildings. The city

is protected by a powerful spell that alerts the entire dao

population if a visitor steals even a single stone. Theft is

punishable by death, with punishment extending to  the

thief's relatives.

The mountains nearest the Fountains of Creation (on

the Plane of Fire) are called the Furnaces. Lava seeps

through their caverns, and the air reeks of sulfur. The

dao have great forges and smelting furnaces here to

process their ores and shape their precious metals.

The border region between the planes of Water and

Earth is a horrid swamp where twisted, gnarled trees

and thick, stinging vines grow from the dense muck and

slime. Here and there within the Swamp of Oblivion

(also called the Plane of Ooze), stagnant lakes and pools

play host to thickets of weeds and monstrous swarms of

mosquitoes. The few settlements here consist of wooden

structures suspended above the muck. Most are built on

platforms between trees, but a few stand on stilts driven

deep into the muck. No solid earth underlies the mud

of the swamp, so houses built on poles eventually sink

down into it.

It is said that any object cast into the Swamp of

Oblivion can't be found again for at least a century. Now

and then, a desperate soul casts an artifact of power into

this place, removing it from  the multiverse for a time.

The promise of powerful magic lures adventurers to

brave the monstrous insects and hags of the swamp in

search of these treasures.

The region of the plane nearest the Swamp of

Oblivion is called the Mud Hills. Landslides constantly

wear away the slopes of the hills, sending cascades

of earth and stone into the bottomless swamp. The

Plane of Earth seems to constantly regenerate the land,

pushing new hills up as the old ones erode to nothing.

PLANE  OF  FIRE

Fire represents vibrancy, passion, and change. At

its worst, it is cruel and wantonly destructive, as the

efreet often are, but at its best, fire reflects the light of

inspiration, the warmth of compassion, a nd the flame

of desire.

A blazing sun hangs at the zenith of a golden sky

above the Plane of Fire, waxing and waning on a

1-l-hour cycle. It ranges from white hot at noon to deep

::-ed at midnight, so the darkest hours of the plane

display a deep red twilight. At noon, the light is nearly

lin ding. Most business in the City of Brass (see below)

takes place during the darker hours.

The weather on the plane is marked by fierce winds

and thick ash. Although the air is breathable, creatures

ot native to the plane must cover their mouths and

eyes  to avoid stinging cinders. The efreet use magic to

eep the cinder storms away from the City of Brass,

ut elsewhere in the plane, the wind is always at least

lustery and rises to hurricane force during the

orst storms.

The heat in the Plane of Fire is compa rable to

a hot desert on the Material Pla ne,  and poses a

::imilar threat to travelers (see "Extreme Heat"  in

hapter  5, "Adventure Environme nts"). The deeper

one goes into the plane, the rarer water becomes.

3eyond a point, the plane holds  no sources of water,



travelers must carry their own supplies or produce

ater by magic.

The Plane of Fire is dominated by the vast Cinder

astes, a great expanse of black cinders and embers

ossed by rivers of lava. Roving bands of salamanders

bartle each other, raid azer outposts, and avoid the

~ reet.  Ancient ruins dot the desert- remnants of

:"orgotten civilizations.

A great range of volcanic mountains called the

Fountains of Creation is home to azers. These rocky

lands of obsidian and basalt jut up from the sea,

otted with ancient ruins and the lairs of powerful

::-ed  dragons. On the shore of the Sea of Fire stands

the City of Brass.

TH E  CITY OF  BRASS

Perhaps the best-known location in the Inner Planes is

the City of Brass, on the shores of the Sea of Fire. This

i  the fabled city of the efreet, and its ornate spires and

metal walls reflect their grandiose and cruel nature.

True to  the nature of the Plane of Fire, everything in

,

the city seems alive with dancing flames , reflecting the

.;bra nt energy of the place.

Adventurers frequently come he re on quests for

.egendary magic. If it's possible to buy magic items at

all . the City of Brass is the most likely place to find any

item for sale, though the price might wei! be more than

gold. The efreet are fond  of trad ing in favors , especially

when they have the upper hand in  negotiations. Perhap

a magical disease or poison ca n be cured only with

something that must be purchased in  the bazaars

of the city.

The heart of the city is the towering Charcoal

Palace, where the tyrannical sultan of the efreet reigns

supreme, surrounded by efreet nobles and a host of

slaves, guardians, and sycophants.

PLANE  OF WATER

The nature of water is to  flow, not like the gusting wind

or the leaping flame , but smoothly and steadily. It is the

rhythm of the tide, the nectar of life, the bitter tears of

mourning, and the balm of sympathy and healing. Given

time, it can erode all  in its path.

A warm sun arcs across the sky of the Plane of

Water, seeming to  rise and set from within the water

at the visible edge of the horizon . Several times a day,

however, the sky clouds over and releases a deluge

of rain, often accompanied by spectacular shows of

lightning, before clearing up again. At night, a glittering

array of stars and auroras bedecks the sky.

The Plane of Water is an endless sea, called the Sea

of Worlds, dotted here and there with atolls and islands

that rise up from enormous coral reefs that seem to

stretch forever into the depths. The storms that move

across the sea sometimes create temporary portals

to the Material Plane and draw ships into the Plane

of Water. Surviving vessels from countless worlds

and navies ply these waters with little hope of ever

returning home.

The weather on the plane is a lesson in extremes.

If the sea isn't calm, it is battered by storms. On rare

oc.casions, a tremor in  the planar firmament sends a

rogue wave sweeping across the plane, swamping entire

islands and driving ships down to the reefs.

Life flourishes in  the upper reaches of the Sea of

Worlds, called the Sea of Light because of the sunlight

filtering down into the water. Aquatic humanoids craft

castles and fortresses in the coral reefs. The marids

are the distant stewards of this region, content to  allow

the lesser folk to compete for territory. The nominal

emperor of the marids dwells in the Citadel ofTen

Thousand Pearls, an opulent palace made of coral and

studded with pearls.

The deeper extents of the plane, where no sunlight

reaches, are called the Darkened Depths. Horrid

creatures dwell here, and the absolute cold and crushing

pressure mean a swift end to creatures accustomed

to the surface or the Sea of Light. Krakens and other

mighty leviathans claim this realm.

Any land that rises above the surface of the sea is

hotly contested by the few  air-breathers that live on the

plane. Fleets of rafts and ships lashed together serve

as solid ground where nothing else is available. Most

natives of the plane never break the surface of the sea

and thus ignore these habitations.

One of the few actual islands on the plane is the Isle

of Dread. The island is connected to the Material Plane

by means of a regular storm that sweeps over the island.

THE

EM ENTAL

PLANES

~rave lers who know the strange tides and currents

of the plane can travel between worlds freely,  but the

5  orms also wreck ships from the Material Plane on the

a nd's shore.

The region of the Plane of Water nearest the Swamp

of Oblivion (on the Plane of Earth) is called the Silt

Flats. The water is thick with soil and sludge, and turns

.mo muddy ground before giving way to the great swamp

between the planes.

At the other extreme of the plane is the Sea oflce,

bordering the Frostfell. The frigid water is choked with

cebergs and sheet ice, inhabited by the cold-loving

creatures that inhabit the Frostfell. Drifting icebergs

can carry these creatures farther into the Plane of

'Yater to threaten ships and islands in warmer seas.

The Frostfell, also called the Plane of Ice, forms the

border between the planes of Air and Water and is a

seemingly endless glacier swept by constant, raging

bl izzards. Frozen caverns twist through the Plane of

Ice,  home to yetis, remorhazes, white dragons, and other

creatures of cold. The inhabitants of the plane engage in

a never-ending battle to prove their strength and ensure

their survival.

Its dangerous monsters and bitter cold make the

F rostfell a dangerous place to travel. Most planar

:oyagers keep to  the air, braving the powerful winds and

driving snow to  avoid setting foot on the great glacier.

OUTER PLANES

Streamers of noxious gas streaked that crimson dome like

dirty clouds.  They whirled to form  what looked like giant

eyes staring down , eyes that were swept away before they

couldfocus, only to form  anew, again and again.  Beneath

the ruby glow lay a dark nightmare land of bare rock and

flumes of sparks and goutingjlame, where things slithered

and scrambled half-seen in  the shadows. Mountains clawed

the ruby sky.  The Land of Teeth , Azuth had once aptly

called it, surveying the endless jagged rocks.  This was the

Greeting Ground, the realm  of horror that had claimed

the lives of countless mortals. He was whirling along above

Avernus,  uppermost of the Nine Hells.

Ed Greenwood, Elminster in Hell

If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that

makes up  the multiverse, the Outer Planes provide the

direction , thought, and purpose for  its construction.

Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as

divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for  the

Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.

When discussing anything to do with deities, the

language used must be highly metaphorical. Their

CHAPTER 2  J  CREATING A  MULTlVERSE

57

actual homes aren't literally places at all, but exemplify

the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and

spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine

the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a border

region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond

ordinary sensory experience.

Even in perceptible regions, appearances can be

deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear

hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane.

But the landscape can change at a whim of the powerful

forces that dwell on these planes, which can remake

them completely,  effectively erasing and rebuilding

existence to  better fulfill their divine needs.

Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the

Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes can

seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what

seems like infinity. Adventurers could take a guided

tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth,

in a single day- if the powers of the Hells desire it.  Or it

could take weeks for  travelers to make a grueling trek

across a single layer.

The default Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes

that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding

neutrality, which is represented by the Outlands,

described in the section on "Other Planes") and the

shades of distinction between them.

The planes with an element of good in their nature are

called the Upper Planes, while those with an element

of evil are the Lower Planes. A plane's alignment is

its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn't

match the plane's alignment experiences a sense of

dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium,

for example, it feels in  tune with the plane, but an

evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little

uncomfortable.

The Upper Planes are the home of celestial creatures ,

including angels, couatls , and pegasi. The Lower Pla nes

are the home of fiends:  demons, devils, yugoloths,

and their ilk. The planes in between host their own

unique denizens: the construct race of modrons

thrive  in Limbo.

LAYERS  OF THE  O U TER PLANES

Most of the Outer Planes include a number of distinct

environments or realms. These realms are often

imagined and depicted as a stack of related parts of the

same plane, so travelers refer to them as layers. For

example, Mount Celestia resembles a seven-tiered layer

cake, the Nine Hells has nine layers, and the Abyss has

a seemingly endless number of layers.

Most portals from elsewhere reach the first layer of a

multilayered plane. This layer is variously depicted as

the top or bottom layer, depending on the plane. As the

arrival point for most visitors, the first layer functions

like a city gate for  that plane.

TRAVELING THE  OUTER PLANES

Traveling between the Outer Planes isn't dissimilar

from reaching the Outer Planes in the first place.

Characters traveling by means of the astral projection

spell can go  from one plane into the Astral Plane, and

there search out a color pool leading to the desired

destination. Characters can also use plane shift to  reach

a different plane more directly. Most often, though,

characters use portals- either a portal that links the two

planes directly or a portal leading to  Sigil, City of Door  .

which holds portals to all the planes.

Two planar features connect multiple Outer Planes

together: the River Styx and the Infinite Staircase.

Other planar crossings might exist in your campaign,

such as a World Tree whose roots touch the Lower

Planes and whose branches reach to the Upper Planes.

or it might be possible to walk from one plane to another

in your cosmology.

THE RIVER STYX

This river bubbles with grease, foul flotsam, and

the putrid remains of battles along its banks. Any

creature other than a fiend that tastes or touches the

water is affected by a feeblemind spell. The DC of the

Intelligence saving throw to resist the effect is  15.

The Styx churns through the top layers of Acheron,

the Nine Hells, Gehenna, Hades, Carceri, the Abyss, and

Pandemonium. Tributaries of the Styx snake onto lower

layers of these planes. For example, a tendril of the Styx

winds through every layer of the Nine Hells, allowing

passage from one layer of that plane to the next.

Sinister ferries float on the waters of the Styx, crewed

by pilots skilled in negotiating the unpredictable

currents and eddies of the river. For a price, these pilots

are willing to carry passengers from plane to plane.

Some of them are fiends, while others are the souls of

dead creatures from the Material Plane.

THE INFINITE  STAIRCASE

The Infinite Staircase is an extradimensional spiral

staircase that connects the planes. An entrance to the

Infinite Staircase usually appears as a nondescript

door. Beyond the portal lies a small landing with an

equally nondescript stairway leading up and down. The

Infinite Staircase changes appearance as it climbs and

MOUNT  CELESTIA

The single sacred mountain of Mount Celestia rises

from a shining Silver Sea to heights barely visible and

utterly incomprehensible, with seven plateaus marking

its seven heavenly layers. The plane is the model of

justice and order, of celestial grace and endless mercy,

where angels and champions of good guard against

incursions of evil. It is one of the few places on the

planes where travelers can let down their guard. Its

inhabitants strive constantly to be as righteous as

possible. Countless creatures aim to reach the highest

and most sublime peak of the mountain, but only the

purest souls can. Gazing toward that peak fills even the

most jaded of travelers with awe.

OPTIONAL RULE:  BLESSED  BENEFICENCE

In contrast to  the dissonance experienced by evil

creatures here, good creatures are literally blessed by

the pervasive beneficence of the plane. Creatures of

good alignment gain the benefit of the bless spell as long

as they remain on the plane. In addition, finishing a long

rest on the plane grants a good creature the benefit of a

lesser restoration spell.

BYTOPIA

The two layers of the Twin Paradises of Bytopia are

similar yet opposite: one is a tamed , pastoral landscape

and the other an untamed wilderness, yet both reflect

the plane's goodness and its acceptance of law and

order when necessary. Bytopia is the heaven of

productive work, the satisfaction of a job well done. The

goodness flowing through the plane creates feelings of

goodwill and happiness in creatures dwelling there.

OPTIONAL RULE :  PERVASIVE  GOODWILL

At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a

visitor that is neither lawful good nor neutral good

CHAPTER  2  I CREATING A  MULTIVERSE

59

must make a DC  10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed

save, the creature's alignment changes to lawful good

or neutral good (whichever is closer to the creature's

current alignment). The change becomes permanent

if the creature doesn't leave the plane within ld4 days.

Otherwise, the creature's alignment reverts to normal

after one day spent on a plane other than Bytopia.

Casting the dispel evil and good spell on the creature

also restores its original alignment.

ELYSIUM

Elysium is home to creatures of unfettered kindness and

compassion, and a welcome refuge for planar travelers

seeking a safe haven. The plane's bucolic landscapes

glimmer with life and beauty in their prime. Tranquility

seeps into the bones and souls of those who enter the

plane. It is the heaven of well-earned rest, a place where

tears of joy glisten on many a cheek.

OPTIONAL RuLE :  OvERWHELMING joY

Visitors spending any time on this plane risk becoming

trapped by overwhelming sensations of contentment

and happiness. At the end of each long rest taken on

this plane, a visitor must make a DC  10 Wisdom saving

throw. On a failed save, the creature is unwilling to  leave

the plane before taking another long rest. After three

failed saving throws, the creature never willingly leaves

the plane and, if forcibly removed, does everything in its

power to  return to the plane. A dispel evil and good spell

removes this effect from the creature.

THE  BEASTLANDS

The Beastlands is a plane of nature unbound, of forests

ranging from moss-hung mangroves to snow-laden

pines, of thick jungles where the branches are woven so

tight that no light penetrates, of vast plains where grains

and wildflowers wave in the wind with vibrant life. The

plane embodies nature's wildness and beauty, but it also

speaks to the animal within all living things.

OPTIONAL RULE :  HUNTER'S  PARADISE

Visitors to the Beastlands find  their hunting and

stalking capabilities improved, and characters have

advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling), Wisdom

(Perception), and Wisdom (Survival) checks while there.

OPTIONAL RULE :  BEAST TRANSFORMATION

Whenever a visitor slays a beast native to the plane, the

slayer must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw

or become transformed (as the polymorph spell) into the

type of beast that was slain. In this form,  the creature

retains its intelligence and ability to speak. At the end of

each long rest, the polymorphed creature can repeat the

saving throw. On a successful saving throw, the creature

returns to its true form. After three failed saving throws.

the transformation can be undone only by a remove

curse spell or similar magic.

ARBOREA

Larger than life, Arborea is a place of violent moods

and deep affections, of whim backed by steel, and of

passions that blaze brightly until they burn out. Its

good-natured inhabitants are dedicated to  fighting evil,

but their reckless emotions sometimes break free with

devastating consequences. Rage is as common and as

honored as joy in Arborea. There the mountains and

forests are extravagantly massive and beautiful, and

every glade and stream is inhabited by nature spirits

that brook no infringement. Travelers must tread lightly.

Arborea is home to many elves and elven deities. Elve

born on this plane have the celestial type and are wild at

heart, ready to battle evil in a heartbeat. Otherwise, they

look and behave like normal elves.

CHAPTER  2  I CREATING  A  MULTIVERSE

O PTIONAL RULE:  INTENS E  YEARN ING

eep track of how many days a visitor spends on

borea. When the visitor leaves, it must make a

a risma saving throw against a DC of 5, plus 1 for

ach day spent on the plane. On a failed save, the

:;eature becomes afflicted with a yearning to return to

;borea. As long as the effect persists, the creature has

~dvantage on ability checks. At the end of each long

~-r. the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending

e effect on a success. A dispel evil and good spell

~move s this effect from the creature.

GARD

:gard is a rugged realm of soaring mountains, deep

d  . and windswept battlefields, with summers that

e long and hot, and winters that are wickedly cold

unforgiving. Its continents float above oceans of



a nic rock, below which are icy caverns so enormous

...  o hold entire kingdoms of giants, humans, dwarves,

_- mes, and other beings. Heroes come to Ysgard to

.:-their mettle not only against the plane itself, but also

:ainst giants, dragons, and other terrible creatures  that

:..:nder across Ysgard's vast terrain.

?TI ONAL RULE :  IMMORTAL WRATH

~,ard is the home of slain heroes who wage eternal

e on fields of glory. Any creature, other than a

~  ruct or undead, that is killed by an attack or a

-   while on Ysgard is restored to life at dawn the next

_.  The creature has all its hit points restored, and all

[ions and afflictions it suffered before its death

bo is a plane of pure chaos, a roiling soup of

rmanent matter and energy. Stone melts into

.  [hat freezes  into metal, then turns into diamond

that burns up into smoke that becomes snow, and

on and on in an endless, unpredictable process of

change. Fragments of more ordinary landscapes- bits

of forest, meadow, ruined castles, and even burbling

streams-drift through the disorder. The whole plane is

a nightmarish riot.

Limbo has no gravity, so creatures visiting the plane

float in place. A creature can move up to its walking

speed in any direction by merely thinking of the desired

direction of travel.

Limbo conforms to the will of the creatures inhabiting

it. Very disciplined and powerful minds can create

whole islands of their own invention within the plane,

sometimes maintaining those places for years. A

simpleminded creature such as a fish , though, might

have less than a minute before the pocket of water

surrounding it freezes , vanishes, or turns to glass.

The slaadi live here and swim amid this chaos,

creating nothing, whereas githzerai monks build entire

monasteries with their minds.

OPTIONAL RULE:  POWER OF THE  MIND

As an action, a creature on Limbo can make an

Intelligence check to mentally move an object on

the plane that it can see within 30 feet of it.  The DC

depends on the object's size: DC 5 for Tiny, DC 10 for

Small, DC  15 for  Medium, DC 20 for  Large, and DC 25

for Huge or larger. On a successful check, the creature

moves the object 5 feet plus 1 foot for every point by

which it beat the DC.

A creature can also use an action to make an

Intelligence check to alter a non magical object that isn't

being worn or carried. The same rules for distance

apply, and the DC is based on the object's size: DC

10 for Tiny, DC 15 for Small, DC 20 for Medium, and

DC 25 for Large or larger. On a success, the creature

changes the object into another nonliving form of the

same size, such as turning a  boulder into a ball of fire.

Finally, a creature can use an action to make an

Intelligence check to stabilize a spherical area centered

on the creature. The DC depends on the radius of the

sphere. The base DC is 5 for a 10-foot-radius sphere;

each additional 10 feet added to  the radius increases the

DC by 5. On a successful check, the creature prevents

the area from being altered by the plane for 24 hours, or

until the creature uses this ability again.

PANDEMONIUM

Pandemonium is a plane of madness, a great mass of

rock riddled with tunnels carved by howling winds. It is

cold, noisy, and dark, with no natural light. Wind quickly

extinguishes nonmagical open flames such as torches

and campfires. It also makes conversation possible only

by yelling, and even then only to  a maximum distance

of 10 feet.  Creatures have disadvantage on any ability

check that relies on hearing.

Most of the plane's inhabitants are creatures that were

banished to the plane with no hope of escape, and many

of them have been driven mad by the incessant winds

or forced to take shelter in places where the winds die

down until they sound like distant cries of torment.

OPTIONAL RULE:  MAD WINDS

A visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw

after each hour spent among the howling winds. On a

failed save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion.

A creature that reaches six levels of exhaustion while

on this plane doesn't die.  Instead, the creature gains

a random form of indefinite madness, as described in

chapter 8 , "Running the Game." Finishing a long rest

doesn't reduce a creature's exhaustion level unless the

creature can somehow escape the maddening winds.

THE ABYSS

---------- --

The Abyss embodies all that is perverse, gruesome, and

chaotic. Its virtually endless layers spiral downward into

ever more appalling forms.

Each layer of the Abyss boasts its own horrific

environment. Although no two layers are alike, they are

all  harsh and inhospitable. Each layer also reflects the

en tropic nature of the Abyss. In fact,  much of what one

sees or touches on the plane seems to  be in a decaying,

crumbling, or corroded state.

OPTIONAL RULE:  ABYSSAL  CORRUPTION

A non-evil visitor that finishes a long rest in the Abyss

must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a

failure, the creature becomes corrupted. Refer to  the

Abyssal Corruption table to determine the effects of

this corruption. You can substitute different corruption

effects of your own creation.

After finishing a long rest, a corrupted creature can

make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful

save, the corruption effect ends. A dispel evil and good

spell or any magic that removes a curse also ends

the effect.

If a corrupted creature doesn't leave the plane within

ld4 + 2 days, its alignment changes to chaotic evil.

Casting the dispel evil and good spell on the creature

restores its original alignment.

good or simi lar  magic. Whenever the possessed

character rolls  a  1 on  an  attack roll,  ability check,

or saving throw, the demon takes control  of the

character and determines the character's  behavior.

At the end  of each of the possessed character's

turns,  he or she can  make a  DC  15  Charisma saving

throw.  On a  success, the character regains control

until  he or she rolls  another 1.

IMPORTANT LAYERS

The layers of the Abyss are defined by the demon lords

who rule them, as the following examples illustrate.

More information about the demon lords can be found in

the Monster Manual.

The Gaping Maw. Demogorgon's layer in the Abyss

is a vast wilderness of savagery and madness known

as the Gaping Maw, where even powerful demons

go insane with fear.  Reflecting Demogorgon's dual

nature, the Gaping Maw consists of a massive primeval

continent covered in dense jungle, surrounded by a

seemingly endless expanse of ocean and brine fiats.  The

Prince of Demons rules his layer from two serpentine

towers, which emerge from  a turbid sea. Each tower

is topped with an enormous fanged skull. The spires

constitute the fortress of Abysm , where few creatures

can venture without descending into madness.

Thanatos. If Orcus had his way,  all planes would

resemble his dead realm of Thanatos, and all creatures

would become undead under his control. Under its

black sky, Thanatos is a land of bleak mountains, barren

moors, ruined cities, and forests of twisted black trees.

Tombs, mausoleums, gravestones, and sarcophagi

litter the landscape. Undead swarm across the plane,

bursting from  their tombs and graves to tear apart any

creatures foolish enough to journey here. Orcus rules

Thanatos from a vast palace known as Everlost, crafted

of obsidian and bone. Set within a howling wasteland

called Oblivion's End, the palace is surrounded by tombs

and burial sites dug into the sheer slopes of narrow

valleys, creating a tiered necropolis.

The Demonweb. Lolth's  layer is an immense network

of thick, magical webbing that forms passageways and

cocoon-like chambers. Throughout the web, buildings,

structures, ships, and other objects hang as if caught

in a spider's snare. The nature of Lolth's web creates

random portals throughout the plane, drawing such

objects in from demiplanes and Material Plane worlds

that figure into the schemes of the Spider Queen.

Lolth's servants also build dungeons amid the webbing,

trapping and hunting Lolth's hated enemies within

crisscrossing corridors of web-mortared stone.

Far beneath these dungeons lie the bottomless

Demonweb Pits where the Spider Queen dwells. There,

Lolth is surrounded by her handmaidens- yochlol

demons created to serve her and which outrank

mightier demons while in the Spider Queen's realm.

The Endless Maze. Baphomet's layer of the Abyss is

a  never-ending dungeon, the center of which holds the

Horned King's enormous ziggurat palace. A confusing

jumble of crooked hallways and myriad chambers, the

palace is surrounded by a mile-wide moat concealing

a maddening series of submerged stairs and tunnels

ead ing deeper into the fortress.

The Triple Realm. The Dark Prince Graz'zt rules

over the realm of Azzagrat, which encompasses three

ayers of the Abyss. His seat of power is the fantastic

Argent Palace in the city of Zelatar, whose bustling

markets and pleasure palaces draw visitors from across

me multiverse in search of obscure magical lore and

perverse delights. By Graz'zt's command, the demons

of Azzagrat present a veneer of civility and courtly

comity.  However, the so-called Triple Realm holds as

uch danger as any other part of the Abyss, and planar

i  itors can vanish without a trace in its mazelike cities

and in forests whose trees have serpents for branches.

Death DeJJs. Yeenoghu rules a layer of ravines known

Death Dells. Here, creatures must hunt to survive.

.=:ven the plants, which must bathe their roots in  blood,

are the unwary. Yeenoghu's servants, helping to sate

eir master's hunger as he prowls his kingdom seeking

_  ey, capture creatures from the Material Plane for

lease in the Gnoll Lord's realm.

CARCERI

:-he model for all other prisons in existence, Carceri

a pla ne of desolation and despair. Its six layers hold

r bogs, fetid jungles, windswept deserts, jagged

ountains, frigid oceans, and black ice. All  form a

erable home for the traitors and backstabbers that

-e trapped on this prison plane.

O PTIONAL RULE:  PRISON PLA NE

_ -o one can leave Carceri easily. Magical efforts to leave

e plane by any spell other than a  wish simply fail.

:>onals and gates that open onto the plane become one

y only. Secret ways out of the plane exist, but they are

-dden and well guarded by traps and deadly monsters.

:-lADES

----------------------------------

e layers of Hades are called the Three Glooms

aces without joy, hope, or passion. A gray land with

:~ ashen sky, Hades is the destination of many souls

ar are unclaimed by the gods of the Upper Planes or

e fie ndish rulers of the Lower Planes. These souls

come larvae and spend eternity in this place that

cks a sun, a moon, stars, or seasons. Leaching away

lor and emotion, this gloom is more than most visitors

can stand. The "Shadowfell Despair" rule earlier in the

apter can be used to represent a visitor's despair.

OPTIONAL RULE :  V I LE TR A NSFORMATION

At the end of each long rest taken on the plane, a visitor

must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed

save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion, which

can't be removed while the creature remains in Hades.

If the creature reaches six levels of exhaustion, it doesn't

die.  Instead, the creature permanently transforms into

a larva, whereupon all levels of exhaustion afflicting the

creature are removed.

A larva is a miserable fiend that retains the facial

features of its previous form but has the body of a fat

worm. A larva has only a few faint memories of its

previous life and the statistics in the larva stat block.

Hades is crawling with larvae. Night hags, liches, and

rakshasas harvest them for  use in vile rituals. Other

fiends like to feed  on them.

GEHENNA

Gehenna is the plane of suspicion and greed. It is the

birthplace of the yugoloths, which dwell here in great

numbers. A volcanic mountain dominates each of the

four layers of Gehenna, and lesser volcanic earth bergs

drift in the air and smash into the greater mountains.

The rocky slopes of the plane make movement here

difficult and dangerous. The ground inclines at least

45 degrees almost everywhere. In places, steep cliffs

and deep canyons present more challenging obstacles.

Hazards include volcanic fissures that vent noxious

fumes or searing flames .

Gehenna has no room for mercy or compassion. The

fiends living here are among the greediest and most

selfish in all the multiverse.

OPTIONAL RULE:  CRUEL HINDRANCE

The plane's cruel nature makes it difficult for visitors to

help one another. Whenever a visitor casts a spell with a

beneficial effect, including a spell that restores hit points

or removes a condition, the caster must first make a DC

10 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the spell

fails , the spell slot is expended, and the action is wasted.

CHAPTER 2  I CREATTNG  A  MULTI VERSE

THE  NINE  HELLS

The Nine Hells of Baa tor inflame the imaginations of

travelers, the greed of treasure seekers, and the battle

fury of all moral creatures. It is the ultimate plane of

law and evil and the epitome of premeditated cruelty.

The devils of the Nine Hells are bound to obey the laws

of their superiors, but they rebel within their individual

castes. Most undertake any plot, no matter how foul ,

to advance themselves. At the very top of the hierarchy

is Asmodeus, who has yet to be bested. If he were to

be vanquished, the victor would rule the plane in turn.

Such is the law of the Nine Hells.

OPTIONAL RULE:  PERVASIVE  EVIL

Evil  pervades the Nine Hells, and visitors to this plane

feel its influence. At the end of each long rest taken on

this plane, a visitor that isn't evil must make a DC 10

Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's

alignment changes to lawful evil. The change becomes

permanent if the creature doesn't leave the plane within

ld4 days. Otherwise, the creature's alignment reverts

to normal after one day spent on a plane other than the

Nine Hells. Casting the dispel evil and good spell on the

creature also restores its original alignment.

THE  NINE  LAYERS

The Nine Hells has nine layers. The first eight are

each ruled by archdevils that answer to Asmodeus,

the Archduke of Nessus, the ninth layer. To reach the

deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend

through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The

most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx,

which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer

to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can

withstand the torment and horror of that journey.

Avernus. No planar portals connect directly to  the

lower layers of the Nine Hells, by Asmodeus's orders.

As such, the first layer of Avernus is the arrival point

for visitors to the plane. A vern us is a rocky wasteland

with rivers of blood and clouds of biting flies.  Fiery

comets occasionally fall from the darkened sky and

leave fuming impact craters behind. Empty battlefields

are littered with weapons and bones, showing where the

legions of the Nine Hells met enemies on their native

soil and prevailed.

The archduchess Zariel rules Avernus, supplanting

her rival, Bel, who has fallen out of Asmodeus's favor

and is forced to serve as Zariel's advisor. Tiamat, the

Queen of Evil Dragons, is a prisoner on this layer,

ruling her own domain but confined to  the Nine Hells

by Asmodeus in accordance with some ancient contract

(the terms of which are known only to Tiamat and the

Lords of the Nine).

Zariel's seat of power is a soaring basalt citadel

festooned with the partially incinerated corpses of

guests who failed to earn the archduchess's favor.  Zariel

appears as an angel whose once-beautiful skin and

wings have been ruined by fire.  Her eyes burn with a

furious white light that can cause creatures looking

upon her to burst into flame .

Dis. Dis, the second layer of the Nine Hells, is a

labyrinth of canyons wedged between sheer mountains

CHAPTER  2  I CREATING A  MULTIVERSE

rich with iron ore. Iron roads span and wend through

the canyons, watched over by the garrisons of iron

fortresses perched atop jagged pinnacles.

The second layer takes its name from its current lord .

Dispater. A manipulator and deceiver, the archduke is

devilishly handsome, bearing only small horns, a tail,

and a cloven left hoof to  disti nguish him from a human.

His crimson throne stands in the heart of the Iron City

of Dis, a hideous metropolis that is the largest in the

Nine Hells. Planar travelers come here to conspire with

devils and to close deals with night hags, rakshasas,

incubi, succubi , and other fiends. Dispater collects a

piece of every deal through special provisions that are

added to contracts signed on his layer of the Nine Hells.

Dispater is one of Asmodeus's most loyal and

resourceful vassals, and few beings in the multiverse

can outwit him. He is more obsessed than most devils

with striking deals with mortals in exchange for their

souls, and his emissaries work tirelessly to foster evil

schemes in the Material Plane.

Minauros. The third layer of the Nine Hells is a

stench-ridden bog. Acidic rain spills from the layer's

brown skies, thick layers of scum cover its putrid

surface, and yawning pits lie in wait beneath the murk to

engulf careless wanderers. Cyclopean cities of ornately

carved stone rise up from the bog, including the great

city of Minauros for which the layer is named.

The slimy walls of the city rise hundreds of feet into

the air, protecting the flooded halls of Mammon . The

Archduke of Minauros resembles a massive serpent

with the upper torso and head of a hairless, horned

humanoid. Mammon's greed is legendary, and he is

one of the few arch devils who will trade favors for gold

instead of souls. His lair is piled high with treasures

left behind by those who tried-and failed-to best him

in a deal.

Phlegethos. Phlegethos, the fourth layer, is a

fiery landscape whose seas of molten magma brew

hurricanes of hot wind, choking smoke, and pyroclastic

ash. Within the fire-filled caldera of Phlegethos's largest

volcano rises Abriymoch, a fortress city cast of obsidian

and dark glass. With rivers of molten lava pouring

down its outer walls, the city resembles the sculpted

centerpiece of a gigantic, hellish fountain.

Abriymoch is the seat of power for  the two archdevils

who rule Phlegethos in tandem: Archduke Belial and

Archduchess Fierna , Belial's daughter. Belial is a

handsome,  powerfully built devil who exudes civility,

even as his words carry an undercurrent of threat. His

daughter is a statuesque devil whose beauty encases the

blackest hear t in  the

and Fierna is unbreakable,  for both are aware that their

mutual survival hinges on it.

ine Hells. The alliance of Belial

Stygia. The fifth layer of the Nine Hells is a freezing

realm of ice within which cold flames burn. A frozen sea

surrounds the layer. and its gloomy sky crackles with

lightning.

Archduke Levistus once betrayed Asmodeus and is

now encased deep in the ice of Stygia as punishment.

He rules this layer all the same, communicating

telepathically with hi  followers and servants, both in

the Nine Hells and on the Material Plane.

Stygia is also home to its previous  ruler, the

serpentine archdevil Geryon, who was dismissed

by Asmodeus to allow the imprisoned Levistus

to  regain his rule. Geryon's fall  from grace has

s purred much debate within the infernal courts. No

one is certain whether Asmodeus had some secret

cause to dismiss the archdevi l or whether he is testing

Geryon's allegiance for some greater purpose.

Malbolge. Malbolge, the sixth layer, has outlasted

many rulers, among them Malagard the Hag Countess

and the archdevil Moloch. Malagard fell  out of favor and

was struck down by Asmodeus in a fit of pique, while

her predecessor, Moloch, still lingers somewhere on

the sixth layer as an imp, plotting to regain Asmodeus's

favor.  Malbolge is a seemingly endless slope, like the

sides of an impossibly huge mountain. Parts of the

layer break off from time to  time, creating deadly and

deafening avalanches of stone. The inhabitants of

.Malbolge live in crumbling fortresses and great caves

carved into the mountainside.

Malbolge's current archduchess is Asmodeus's

daughter, Glasya. She resembles a succubus with

her small horns, leathery wings, and forked tail. She

inherited her cruelty and love of dark schemes from

her father. The citadel that serves as her domicile on

the slopes of Malbolge is supported by cracked pillars

and buttresses that are sturdy yet seem on the verge of

collapse. Beneath the palace is a labyrinth lined with

cells and torture chambers, where Glasya confines and

torments those who displease her.

Maladomini. The seventh layer, Maladomini, is ruin

covered wasteland. Dead cities form a desolate urban

landscape, and between them lie empty quarries,

crumbling roads, slag heaps, the hollow shells of

empty fortresses, and swarms of hungry flies.

The Archduke of Maladomini is Baalzebul,

the Lord of Flies. A bloated fiend with the lower

body of an enormous slug, Baalzebul's form was

in flicted  on him by Asmodeus as punishment for

wavering loyalty. Baalzebul is a miserable and

degenerate monstrosity who has long conspired to

usurp Asmodeus, yet has failed at every turn. He carries

a curse that causes any deal made with him to lead to

ca lamity. Asmodeus occasionally shows Baalzebul favor

fo r reasons no other archduke can fathom , though some

suspect that the Archduke of Ness us still respects the

worthiness of this fallen adversary.

Cania.  Cania, the eighth layer of the Nine Hells, is

an icy hellscape, whose ice storms can tear flesh  from

bone. Cities embedded in the ice provide shelter for

guests and prisoners of Cania's  ruler, the brilliant and

conniving archdevil Mephistopheles.

Mephistopheles dwells in the ice citadel of Mephistar,

where he plots to seize the Throne of Baator and

conquer the planes. He is Asmodeus's greatest enemy

and ally, and the Archduke of Ness us appears to

trust Mephistopheles's counsel when it  is offered.

Mephistopheles knows he can't depose Asmodeus until

his adversary makes a grave miscalculation, and so

both wait to see what circumstances might turn them

against each other. Mephistopheles is also a godfather of

sorts to Glasya, further complicating the relationship.

Mephistopheles is a tall, striking devil with impressive

horns and a cool demeanor. He trades in souls, asv o

other archdevils, but he rarely gives his time to  any

creatures not worthy of his person~! ~ttention .. His

instincts are as razor sharp as Camas fngtd wmds,

and it is said that only Asmodeus has ever d~vea or

thwarted him.

/

Nessus. The lowest layer of the Nine"'Hells, Ness us is

a realm of dark pits whose walls are set with fortresses.

There, pit fiend  generals loyal to Asmodeus garrison

their diabolical legions and p)ot the conquest of the

multiverse. At the center oUhe layer stands a vast

rift of unknown depth, out of which rises the great

citadel-spire of Malsheem, home to Asmodeus and his

infernal court.

Malsheem resembles a gigantic hollowed-out

stalagmite. The citadel is also a prison for souls that

Asmodeus has locked away for safekeeping. Convincing

him to release even one of those souls comes at a steep

price, and it is rumored that the Archduke of Nessus has

claimed whole kingdoms in the past for such favors.

Asmodeus most often appears as a handsome,

bearded humanoid with small horns protruding from

his forehead, piercing red eyes, and flowing robes.

He can also assume other forms and is seldom seen

without his ruby-tipped scepter in hand. Asmodeus is

the most cunning and well-mannered of archdevils. The

ultimate evil he represents can be seen only when he

wills it so, or if he forgets himself and flies into a rage.

ACHERON

Acheron has four layers, each made of enormous iron

cubes floating in an airy void.  Sometimes the cubes

collide. Echoes of past collisions linger throughout the

plane, mingling with the sounds of armies colliding.

That's the nature of Acheron: strife and war, as the

spirits of fallen soldiers join in endless battle against

orcs devoted to Gruumsh, goblinoids loyal to Maglubiyet,

and legions assembled by other warmongering gods.

OPTIONAL RULE:  BLOODLUST

Acheron rewards a creature for harming other creatures

by imbuing that creature with the strength to keep

fighting. While on Acheron, a creature gains temporary

hit points equal to half its hit point maximum whenever

it reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points.

MECHANUS

On Meehan us, law is reflected in a realm of clockwork

gears. all interlocked and turning according to their

measure. The cogs seem to be engaged in a calculation

so vast that no deity can fathom its purpose. Mechanus

embodies absolute order, and its influence can be felt  on

those who spend time here.

Modrons are the primary inhabitants of Mechanus.

The plane is also home to the creator of the modrons: a

godlike being called Primus.

OPTIONAL RULE:  LAW OF AVERAGES

While on Mechanus, creatures always use the average

damage result for attacks and spells. For example, an

attack that normally deals ldlO + 5 damage always

deals 10 damage on Mechanus.

OPTIONAL RULE:  IMPOSING  ORDER

At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor

that isn't lawful neutral must make a DC 10 Wisdom

saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment

changes to lawful neutral. The creature's alignment

reverts to normal after one day spent on a plane other

than Mechanus. Casting the dispel evil and good spell

on the creature also restores its original alignment.

ARCADI~A~---------------------

Arcadia thrives with orchards of perfectly lined trees,

ruler-straight streams, orderly fields,  perfect roads, and

cities laid out in geometrically pleasing shapes. The

mountains are unblemished by erosion. Everything on

Arcadia works toward the common good and a flawless

form of existence. Here, purity is eternal, and nothing

intrudes on harmony.

Night and day are determined by an orb that floats

above Arcadia's highest peak. Half of the orb radiates

sunlight and brings about the day; the other half sheds

moonlight and brings on the starry night. The orb

rotates evenly without fail,  spreading day and night

across the entire plane.

The weather in Arcadia is governed by four allied

demigods called the Storm Kings: the Cloud King, the

Wind Queen, the Lightning King, and the Rain Queen.

Each one lives in a castle surrounded by the type of

weather that king or queen controls.

Hidden below Arcadia's beautiful mountains are

numerous dwarven kingdoms that have withstood

the passage of millennia. Dwarves born on this plane

66

CHAPTER 2  I CREATING  A  MULTTVERSE

have the celestial type and are always brave and

kindhearted, but otherwise they look and behave like

normal dwarves.

OPTIONAL RULE :  PLANA R VITALITY

Vhile on this plane, creatures can't be frightened or

poisoned, and they are immune to disease and poison.

OTHER PLANES

A va riety of realms exist between or beyond the

other planes.

T HE  OUTLANDS AND  SIGIL

The Outlands is the plane between the Outer Planes.

Ir is the plane of neutrality, incorporating a little of

everything and keeping all aspects in a paradoxical

balance- simultaneously concordant and in opposition.

The plane has varied terrain, with prairies, mountains,

and shallow rivers.

T he Outlands is circular, like a great disk. In fact ,

hose whp envision the Outer Planes as a wheel point

(Q the ovtlands as proof, calling it a microcosm of the

planes. That argument might be circular, since the

arrange~ent of the Outlands inspired the idea of the

Great \\\heel in the first place.

Aroun'd the outside edge of the circle, evenly spaced,

are the g~te-towns: sixteen settlements, each built

around a ~ortalleading to one of the Outer Planes. Each

rown shares many of the characteristics of the plane

where its gate leads. Planar emissaries often meet in

these towns, so it isn't unusual to see strange pairings,

such as a celestial and a fiend  arguing in a tavern while

sharing a fine bottle of wine.

Given the fact that you can ride a horse in the

Outlands from a heaven to a hell, a planar-themed

campaign can be set there without the need for planar

travel. The Outlands is the closest the Outer Planes

come to being like a world on the Material Plane.

CHAPTER  2  I CREATING  A  MULTIVERSE

SIGIL ,  CITY  OF  DOORS

At the center of the Outlands, like the axle of a great

wheel, is the Spire-a needle-shaped mountain that

rises high into the sky. Above this mountain's narrow

peak floats the ring-shaped city of Sigil, its myriad

structures built on the ring's inner rim . Creatures

standing on one of Sigil's streets can see the city curve

up over their heads and- most disconcerting of all-the

far side of the city directly overhead. Called the City of

Doors, this bustling planar metropolis holds countless

portals to other planes and worlds.

Sigil is a trader's paradise. Goods, merchandise, and

information come here from across the planes. The city

sustains a brisk trade in information about the planes,

particularly the command words or items required for

the operation of particular portals. Portal keys of all

kinds are bought and sold here.

The city is the domain of the inscrutable Lady of Pain,

a being as old as gods and with purposes unknown to

even the sages of her city. Is Sigil her prison? Is she the

fallen creator of the multiverse? No  one knows. Or if

they do,  they aren't telling.

DEMIPLANES

Demiplanes are extradimensional spaces that come

into being by a variety of means and boast their own

physical laws. Some are created by spells. Others exist

naturally, as folds of reality pinched off from  the rest

of the multiverse. Theoretically, a plane shift spell can

carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency

required for the tuning fork would be extremely hard to

acquire. The gate spell is more reliable, assuming the

caster knows of the demiplane.

A demiplane can be as small as a single chamber or

large enough to contain an entire realm. For example,

a Mordenkainen 's magnificent mansion spell creates a

demiplane consisting of a foyer with multiple adjoining

rooms, while the land of Barovia (in the Ravenloft

setting) exists entirely within a demiplane under the

sway of its vampire lord, Strahd von Zarovich. When a

demiplane is connected to the Material Plane or some

other plane, entering it can be as simple as stepping

through a portal or passing through a wall of mist.

THE  FAR  REALM

The Far Realm is outside the known multiverse. In

fact,  it might be an entirely separate universe with its

own physical and magical laws. Where stray energies

from the Far Realm leak onto another plane, matter

is warped into alien shapes that defy understandable

geometry and biology. Aberrations such as mind flayers

and beholders are either from this plane or shaped by its

strange influence.

The entities that abide in  the Far Realm itself are

too alien for a normal mind to accept without strain.

Titanic creatures swim through nothingness there, and

unspeakable things whisper awful truths to those who

dare listen. For mortals, knowledge of the Far Realm

is a struggle of the mind to overcome the boundaries of

matter, space, and sanity. Some warlocks embrace this

struggle by forming pacts with entities there. Anyone

KNOWN WORLDS dF THE

I

MATERIAL PLANE

Worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse. The

most widely known worlds are the ones that have been

published as official campaign settings for the D&D

game over the years. If your campaign takes place on

one of these worlds, that world belongs to you in your

campaign. Your version of the world can diverge wildly

from what's in print.

On Toril (the heroic-fantasy world of the Forgotten

Realms setting), fantastic cities and kingdoms stand

amid the remains of ancient empires and realms

long forgotten. The world is vast, its dungeons rich

with history. Beyond the central continent of Faerun ,

Tori! includes the regions of Al-Qadim, Kara-Tur,

and Maztica.

On Oerth (the sword-and-sorcery world of the

Greyhawk setting), heroes such as Bigby and

Mordenkainen are driven by greed or ambition. The

hub of the region called the Flanaess is the Free City of

Greyhawk, a city of scoundrels and arch magi, rife with

adventure. An evil demigod, Iuz, rules a nightmarish

realm in the north, threatening all civilization.

On Krynn (the epic-fantasy world of the Dragonlance

setting),. the return of the gods is overshadowed by the

rise of the evil dragon queen Takhisis and her dragons

and dragonarmies, which plunge the continent of

Ansalon into war.

On Athas (the sword-and-sorcery world of the Dark

Sun setting), a drop of water can be worth more than a

human life. The gods have abandoned this desert world,

where powerful sorcerer-kings rule as tyrants, and

metal is a scarce and precious commodity.

On Eberron (the heroic-fantasy world of the Eberron

setting), a terrible war has ended, giving rise to a cold

war fueled by political intrigue. On the continent of

Khorvaire, magic is commonplace, dragonmarked

houses rival kingdoms in power, and elemental vehicles

make travel to the far corners of the world possible.

On Aebrynis (the heroic-fantasy world of the

Birthright setting), scions born from divine bloodlines

carve up the continent of Cerilia. Monarchs, prelates,

guildmasters, and great wizards balance the demands

of rulership against the threat of horrible abominations

born from the blood of an evil god.

On Mystara (a heroic-fantasy world born out of the

earliest editions of the D&D game), diverse cultures,

savage monsters, and warring empires collide.

The world is further shaped by the meddling of the

Immortals- former adventurers raised to  nearly

divine status.

I' A

CHAPTE R  3:  CREATING A DV ENTURES

~ REATI  G ADVENTURES  IS ONE O F THE GREATEST

rewards of being a Dungeon Master.  It's  a

way to  express yourself, designing fantastic

locations and encounters with monsters,

traps, puzzles, and conflicts. When you

design an adventure, you call the shots. You

o things exactly the way you want to.

Fundamentally, adventures are stories. An adventure

shares many of the features of a novel, a movie, an

:ssue of a comic, or an episode of a TV show. Comic

ser ies and serialized TV dramas are particularly good

com parisons, because of the way individual adventures

are limited in scope but blend together to create a larger

na rrative. If an adventure is a single issue or episode, a

campaign is the series as a whole.

W hether you're creating your own adventures or using

;JUblished adventures, you'll find advice in this chapter

~o help you create a fun and memorable experience for

:.our players.

Creating an adventure involves blending scenes of

exploration, social interaction, and combat into a unified

whole that meets the needs of your players and your

campaign. But it's  more than that. The basic elements

of good storytelling should guide you throughout this

;Jrocess, so your players experience the adventure as a

ory and not a disjointed series of encounters.

ELEMENTS  OF  A

GREAT ADVENTURE

=-he  best adventures have several things in common.

_-\_  C REDIBLE  THREAT

_-\n adventure needs a threat worthy of the heroes'

c.  rention. The threat might be a single villain or

;:nonster, a villain with lackeys, an assortment of

::::wnsters, or an evil organization. Whatever their

arure, the antagonists should have goals that the

:-:eroes can uncover and thwart.

?.-\M ILlAR TROPES WITH  CLEVER TWISTS

:-m ight seem stereotypical to build an adventure

;;sound dragons, orcs, and insane wizards in towers,

"Jut these are staples of fantasy storytelling. It might

also seem trite to begin an adventure in a tavern, but

~h at's an idea that remains true to D&D. Familiar

srory elements are fine,  as long as you and the players

occasionally put a spin on them. For example, the

:-nysterious figure who presents adventurers with

a quest on behalf of the king might be the king in

d.isguise. The crazy wizard in the tower might be a

;Jrojected illusion created by a band of greedy gnome

dlieves to guard their loot.

_\  C LEAR Focus oN THE  PRESE N T

.-ill adventure is about the here and now. A little bit

of history might be needed to set the story in motion,

and the adventurers might discover interesting lore of

:.1e past in the course of the adventure. In gene ral , let

rhe world's  history be evident in the present situation.

Instead of dealing with what happened in the past,

an adventure should focus on describing the present

situation, what the bad guys are up to,  and how the

adventurers become involved in the story.

HEROES WHO  MATTER

An adventure should allow the adve nturers' actions and

decisions to matter. Though it might resemble a novel

or a TV episode, an adventure needs to allow for  more

than one outcome. Otherwise, players can feel  as if

they've been railroaded- set onto a course that has only

one destination, no matter how hard they try to change

it.  For example, if a major villain shows up before the

end of the adventure, the adventure should allow for  the

possibility that the heroes might defeat that villain.

SoMETHING FOR ALL PLAYER TYPES

As outlined in the book's introduction, players come

to the gaming table with different expectations. An

adventure needs to account for  the different players and

characters in your group, drawing them into the story as

effectively as possible.

As a starting point, think about your adventure in

terms of the three basic types of activity in the game:

exploration, social interaction, and combat. If your

adventure includes a balance of all three, it's likely to

appeal to  all types of players.

An adventure you create for your home campaign

doesn't have to appeal to every abstract player type

only to the players sitting down at your own table. If you

don't have any players who like fighting above all else,

then don't feel you have to  provide a maximum amount

of combat to keep the adventure moving.

SURPRISES

Look for opportunities to surprise and delight your

players. For example, the exploration of a  ruined castle

on a hill  might lead to the discovery of a dragon's tomb

hidden underneath. A trek through the wilderness

might lead to the discovery of a tower that appears only

on nights of the full moon. Players remember such

locations.

Too many surprises can be off-putting to players, but

adding the occasional twist gets players to adjust their

tactics and think creatively. For example, you could

spruce up a goblin lair by including goblin sappers

with kegs of oil strapped to their backs. An attack on a

villain's estate might be complicated by the unexpected

arrival of a special guest.

When preparing for possible combat encounters,

think about odd pairings of monsters, such as a

hobgoblin warlord and his pet manticore, or will

o'-wisps in league with a young black dragon. Have

surprise reinforcements show up,  or give the monsters

unusual tactics. Throw in the occasional red herring,

deception, and plot twist to  keep players on their toes,

but try not to go overboard. Sometimes a simple,

straightforward encounter with an ore guard is just as

fun for your players.

CHAPTER  3  I CREATING ADVENTURES

USEFUL MAPS

A good adventure needs thoughtfully constructed

maps. Wilderness areas sprinkled with interesting

landmarks and other features are better than vast

expanses of unchanging terrain. Dungeons that have

branching corridors and similar decision points give

players the opportunity to choose which direction their

characters should go.  Presenting the characters with

options allows the players to make choices that keep the

adventure unpredictable.

If drawing maps isn't your strong suit, the Internet is

a great place to look for adventure maps that have been

made freely available for use, as well as floor plans of

real-world buildings and images that can inspire your

mapmaking. You can also use software to  help put your

maps together.

PUBLISHED ADVENTURES

Published adventures are available for purchase if you

have neither the time nor the inclination to write an

adventure of your own, or if you want a change of pace.

A published adventure includes a pregenerated scenario

with the maps, NPCs, monsters, and treasures you need

to run it. An example of a published adventure appears

in the D&D Starter Set.

You can make adjustments to  a published adventure

so that it better suits your campaign and appeals to

your players. For example, you can replace the villain

of an adventure with one the players have already

encountered in your campaign, or add something to

the background of the adventure so that it involves your

players' characters in ways that the adventure's designer

never could have imagined.

A published adventure can't account for every

action the characters might take. The nice thing

about published adventures is that they allow you to

focus your game preparation time on highlighting plot

developments in your campaign that the adventure

can't address.

Published adventures also provide inspiration. You

might not use an adventure as written, but it  might spur

ideas, or you can pull out one part of it and repurpose

that part for your needs. For example, you might use a

map of a temple but repopulate it with monsters of your

choice, or you might use a chase sequence as a model

for a pursuit scene in your campaign.

ADVENTURE  STRUCTURE

Like every story, a typical adventure has a beginning, a

middle, and an end.

BEGINNING

An adventure starts with a hook to get the players

interested. A good adventure hook piques the interest

of the players and provides a compelling reason for

their characters to become involved in the adventure.

Maybe the adventurers stumble onto something they're

not meant to see, monsters attack them on the road, an

assassin makes an attempt on their lives, or a dragon

shows up at the city gates. Adventure hooks such as

these can instantly draw players into your story.

CHAPTER  3  I CREATJNG ADVENTURES

The beginning of a good adventure should be exciting

and focused. You want the players to go home looking

forward to the next session , so give them a clear sense

of where the story is headed, as well as something to

look forward to.

MIDDLE

The middle of an adventure is where the bulk of the

story unfolds. With each new challenge, the adventurers

make important choices that have a clear effect on the

conclusion of the adventure.

Over the course of the adventure, the characters might

discover secrets that reveal new goals or change their

original goal. Their understanding of what's going on

around them might change. Maybe rumors of treasure

were a trick to lure them into a death trap. Perhaps

the so-called spy in the queen's court is actually a

scheme concocted by the monarch herself to seize even

more power.

At the same time the adventurers are working to

thwart their adversaries, those adversaries are trying

to  carry out their nefarious plans. Such enemies

might also work to hide their deeds, mislead potential

adversaries, or confront problems directly,  perhaps by

trying to kill meddlers.

Remember that the characters are the heroes of the

story. Never let them become mere spectators, watching

as events unfold around them that they can't influence.

ENDING

The ending encompasses the climax- the scene or

encounter in which the tension building throughout the

adventure reaches its peak. A strong climax should have

the players on edge, with the fate of the characters and

much more hanging in the balance. The outcome, which

hinges on the characters' actions and decisions, should

never be a forgone conclusion.

An ending needn't tie everything up in a neat bow.

Story threads can be left hanging, waiting to be resolved

in a later adventure. A little bit of unfinished business is

an easy way to transition from one adventure to the next.

ADVENTURE TYPES

An adve nture can be location-based or event-based, as

discussed in the sections that follow.

LOCATION-BASED ADVENTURES

Adventures set in crumbling dungeons and remote

wilderness locations are the cornerstone of countless

campaigns. Many of the greatest D&D adventures of all

time are location-based.

Creating a location-based adventure can be broken

down into a number of steps. Each step provides tables

from which you can select the basic elements of your

adventure. Alternatively, roll  on the tables and see how

the random results inspire you. You  can mix up the

order of the steps.

1.  IDENTIFY THE  PARTY'S  GOALS

The Dungeon Goals table provides common goals

that drive or lure adventurers into dungeons. The

:,derness Goals table provides similar inspiration for

adventure focused on outdoor exploration. The Other

Chapter 5 offers suggestions for creating and fleshing

out an adventure location, including tables that can

help you establish the important elements of a dungeon,

wilderness area, or urban setting.

4.  FIND THE  IDEAL INTRODUCTION

An adventure can begin with a social interaction

encounter in which the adventurers find  out what they

must do and why. It can start with a surprise attack,

or with the adventurers coming across information by

accident. The best introductions arise naturally from the

goals and setting of the adventure. Let the entries in the

Adventure Introduction table inspire you.

don't overuse it.)

A portal  opens to another plane of existence.

Creatures on  the other side spill  out, forcing the

adventurers to close the portal  and deal with the

villain  at the same time.

Traps , hazards,  or animated  objects turn  against

the adventurers while the main  villain  attacks.

The dungeon  begins to collapse while the

adventurers face the main villain,  who  attempts to

escape in  the chaos.

A threat more powerful than the adventurers

appears, destroys the main villain,  and then turns

its  attention on the characters.

The adventurers  must choose whether to  pursue

the fleeing  main  villain  or save an  N PC  they care

about or a group of innocents.

The adventurers  must discover the main  villain's

secret weakness  before they can  hope to defeat that

villain .

6 . PLA N  E NC OUNTE R S

.:..fter you've created the location and the overall story of

the adventure, it's time to plan out the encounters that

make up that adventure. In a location-based adventure,

most encounters are keyed to specific locations on

a map. For each room or wilderness area on the

adventure map, your key describes what's in that area:

its physical features, as well as any encounter that plays

out there. The adventure key turns a simple sketch

of numbered areas on graph paper into encounters

designed to  entertain and intrigue your players.

See "Creating Encounters" later in this chapter for

guidance on crafting individual encounters.

EVENT- BASED ADVENTURES

In an event-based adventure, the focus is on what the

characters and villains do and what happens as a

result. The question of where those things happen is of

secondary importance.

Building an event-based adventure is more work than

building a location-based one, but the process can be

simplified by following a number of straightforward

steps. Several steps include tables from which you

can choose adventure elements or roll randomly for

inspiration. As with location-based adventures, you don't

necessarily have to follow these steps in order.

1.  START  WITH A  VILLAIN

Putting care into creating your villain will pay off later,

since the villain plays such a pivotal role in advancing

the story. Use the Adventure Villains table in the

previous section to get started, and use the information

in chapter 4 to  help flesh  out the villain.

For example, your villain might be an undead creature

seeking to avenge a past imprisonment or injury. An

interesting aspect of an undead villain is that this past

injury might have occurred centuries ago, inspiring

revenge against the descendants of those that harmed

it.  Imagine a vampire imprisoned by the members of a

religious order of knights, and who now seeks revenge

against the current members of that order.

2. DET E RMINE T HE VI L LAIN'S ACTIONS

Once you have a villain , it's time to determine what

steps the villain takes to achieve its goals . Create a

timeline showing what the villain does and when,

assuming no interference from the adventurers.

Building on the previous example, you might decide

that your vampire villain murders several knights. By

slipping past locked doors in gaseous form , the vampire

is able to make the deaths appear natural at first,  but

it soon becomes clear that a depraved killer is behind

the murders.

If you need additional inspiration, consider a few

different options for how the villain's  actions unfold over

the course of the adventure.

Big Event. The villain's plans come to fruition during

a festival, an astrological event, a holy (or unholy) rite, a

royal wedding, the birth of a child, or some similar fixed

time. The villain's activities up to  that point are geared

toward preparation for this event.

Crime Spree. The villain commits acts that become

bolder and more heinous over time. A killer might start

out by targeting the destitute in the city slums before

moving up to a massacre in the marketplace, increasing

the horror and the body count each time.

CHAPTER  3  I CREATTNG ADVEN TURES

75

ongoing plan to  commit more crimes, the villain's goal is

to  lie low or flee  the scene.

Serial Crimes. The villain commits crimes one after

the other, but these acts are repetitive in nature, rather

than escalating to greater heights of depravity. The

trick to catching such a villain lies in determining the

pattern underlying the crimes. Though serial killers are

a common example of this type of villain, your villain

could be a serial arsonist favoring a certain type of

building, a magical sickness that affects spellcasters

who cast a specific spell, a thief that targets a certain

kind of merchant, or a doppelganger kidnapping and

impersonating one noble after another.

Step by Step. In pursuit of its goal, the villain carries

out a specific set of actions in a particular sequence.

A wizard might steal the items needed to create a

phylactery a nd become a lich, or a cultist might kidnap

the priests of seven good-aligned gods as a sacrifice.

Alternatively, the villain could be following a trail to  find

the object of its revenge, killing one victim after another

while moving ever closer to the real target.

3.  DETERMINE THE  PARTY'S  GOALS

You  can use the Event-Based Goals table to set the

party's goal. A goal can also suggest ways in which the

adventurers become caught up in the villain's plans, and

what exactly they must do to foil  those plans.

EVENT-BASED  GOALS

For example, you  roll a  10 on the table, indicating that

the party's goal is to secure aid from a ruler or council.

You  decide to  connect that to the leadership of the order

targeted by your vampire villain. Maybe the order's

leaders have a chest of jewels stolen from the vampire

centuries ago, and the characters can  use the chest as

bait to trap the villain.

VAMPIRE  VILLAIN

Growing Corruption. As time passes, the villain's

power and influence grow, affecting more victims

across a larger area. This might take the form  of armies

conquering new territory, an evil  cult recruiting new

members, or a spreading plague. A pretender to the

throne might attempt to  secure the support of the

kingdom's nobility in the days or weeks leading up to a

coup, or a guild leader could corrupt the members of a

town council or bribe officers of the watch.

One and Done. The villain commits a single crime

and then tries to avoid the consequences. Instead of a n

CHAPTER  3  I CREATING  ADYENTURES

ClOk for simple solutions to  its problems or create more

:omplicated schemes to route around interference?

Look over the villain's actions that you outlined in

:;e p 2.  For each event arising from those actions, think

about how the adventurers are likely to react. If they

:an prevent an action or hamper its success, what effect

::oes  that have on the villain's overall plan? What can

ae villain do to compensate?

One way to  track a villain's reactions is by using a

:':owchart. This might grow out of the timeline that

;:!escribes the villain's plans, outlining how the villain

gets back on track after the adventurers thwart its plans.

Or the flowchart could be separate from  the timeline,

haw ing the various actions the adventurers might take

and the villain's response to those actions.

6. DETAIL KEY LOCATIONS

~ ince locations aren't the focus of the adventure, they

a n be simpler and smaller than a dungeon complex

or a n expanse of wilderness. They might be specific

. ocations in a city,  or even individual rooms in locations

,yhere combat is likely to break out or significant

exploration is needed, such as a throne room, a guild

~ e adq uarters ,  a vampire's crumbling manor, or a

~ ights' chapter house.

7.  CHOOSE AN INTRODUCTION AND  A  CLIMAX

The Adventure Introduction table in the "Location

Based Adventures" section offers fun  possibilities

:or hooking the characters into the events of your

adventure, including dreams, hauntings, and a simple

plea for help. The Adventure Climax table in that same

ection includes adventure endings that work just as

well  for event-based adventures.

For example, the Adventure Introduction table helps

you decide that an ally the adventurers care about needs

their help. Perhaps the NPC is a kni ght who believes

that a vampire is trying to kill him , or a friend or relative

hoping to find  the knight's  murderer. This NPC brings

the vampire's crimes to the characters' attention.

Looking over the Adventure Climax table, you might

decide to have the adventurers bait the vampire with a

chest of jewels stolen from its lair. As an added twist,

you decide that the vampire's  true goal is to retrieve a

necklace among the jewels. The necklace is set with

nine gems, and with these gems the vampire can open

a gate to the Nine Hells. Should the vampire succeed,

the adventurers will have a more pressing threat to deal

with, as a powerful devil steps through the gate and

honors some ancient pact it made with the vampire.

8.  PLAN  ENCOUNTERS

After you've created the overall story of the adventure,

it's  time to plan out the encounters on which the

events of that adventure will hang. In an event-based

adventure, encounters occur when the villain's agenda

intersects the path of the characters. You can't always

anticipate exactly when or where that will happen, but

you can create a list of possible encounters that the

adventurers might experience. This can take the form of

general descriptions of the villain's forces, details of its

lieutenants and minions, as well as encounters tied to

the key locations of the adventure.

S ee "Creating Encounters" later in this chapter for

guidance on crafting individual encounters.

MYSTERIES

A mystery is a form of event-based adventure that

usually focuses on the adventurers' efforts to solve a

crime, usually a robbery or murder. Unlike the writer of

a mystery novel, a Dungeon Maste r can't always predict

what the characters will do in a myste ry adventure.

A villain whose actions are "crime spree," "one and

done," or "serial crimes" might inspire you to craft

a myste ry adventure around that villain's crimes.

Similarly, if the adventurers' goals include determining

the villain's identity, that might be part of a  mystery.

To build a mystery adventure, follow the steps for

creating any event-based adventure. Then consider

three additional elements for  the adventure: the victim,

the suspects, and the clues .

VICTIM

Think about the victim's relationship to  the villain.

Though you can create a strong scenario with no such

relationship, part of what makes a mystery exciting is

the discovery of the twisted connections betwee n NPCs

and how those connections led to  the crime. A random

killing might be just as mysterious, but it lacks that

emotional connection.

Also look for a connection between the victim and one

or more of the adventurers. One surefire way to draw

adventurers into a mystery- including making them

suspects- is to make the victim someone with whom the

characters are acquainted.

SUSPECTS

Your cast of characters should include an assortment

of other NPCs who didn't commit the crime,  but who

had the motive, the means, or the opportunity to do so.

CHAPTER  3  I CREATING  ADVENTURES

77

Suspects might be obvious or could come to light during

the investigation. One technique often used in detective

fiction  is  to  create a closed circle of suspects-a finite

number of individuals whose circumstances make them

the only possible suspects.

One tip for keeping the players and the adventurers

guessing as to the ide ntity of the villain is  to ensure that

more than one suspect has a secret. When questioned

by the adventurers, a suspect might appea r nervous or

attempt to  lie,  despite being innocent of the crime. A

secret bus iness deal, an illicit affair, a dark past, or an

uncontrolled vice are fl aws that make suspects more

interesting than NPCs with  nothing to  hide.

CLUES

Clues point to the identity of the villain. Some clues are

verbal, including the statements of the s us pects and

witnesses that help the adven turers  develop a picture

of what happened. Other clues are physical, such as a n

unfinis hed message written in the victim's blood, a piece

of jewelry left behind by the villain, or a weapon found

hidden in a s uspect's  room .

A clue should connect a suspect to the crime, typically

by shedding light on the suspect's motive, means , or

opportunity. Some clues connect the wrong suspect

to  the crime, leading the adventurers in the wrong

direction. Eventually, they must find other clues pointing

in a different direction, or come across evidence th at

absolves the suspect.

It's  better to  populate your adventure with too many

clues than too few.  If the adventurers solve the mystery

too quickly, you might feel some disappointment but

the players will feel  a sense of accomplishment. If the

mystery is too hard, though, the players will become

frustrated . Since you have to account for the possibility

that the adventurers w ill overlook some clues, use

redundant clues to  ensure that the players have the

knowledge needed to  catch the villain.

INTRIGUE ----

Intrigue adventures are event-based adventures that

revolve around powe r struggles. Intrigues a re common

in the courts of the nobility, but power s truggles can

play out just as easily in merchants' guilds, crime

syndicates, a nd te mple hierarchies .

Rather than dark events and villainous plots, an

intrigue adventure typically revolves around the

exchange of favors , the rise and fall of individuals

in power a nd influence,  a nd the honeyed words of

diplomacy.  A prince's efforts to be named heir to  the

throne,  a courtier's ambition to sit at the queen's right

hand, and a merchant's desire to open a trade route

through enemy lands are the stuff of intrigue.

Like all adventures, a n intrigue adventure works only

if the players a nd their characters are invested in the

outcome. If no one cares who the king's chamberlain is

or who has logging rights in the elven woods, throwing

the characters into an adventure centered on those

issues will fall fiat.  However, if having the ear of the

king's chamberlain means the characters can use royal

soldiers to help them defend their own stronghold on the

borde rla nds, players will be invested in the scenario.

CHAPTER  3  I CREATING  ADVENTURES

Adventure rs usually become embroiled in intrigue

when they need a favor from a powerful  creature and

have to  pe rform  a favor in exchange, or when the plots

of powerful NP Cs get in the way of the characters

achieving their goals. Some of the event-based goals

discussed earlier in this section lend themselves to

intrigue adventures. For example, if the adventurers

must uncover a conspiracy, negotiate a peace treaty, or

secure aid from  a ruler or council, you might be looking

at an intrigue adventure.

The process of creating a n intrigue adventure is

similar to creating a ny other event-based adventure,

with two m ain differences: how villains are handled a nd

how the cha racters can gain influence.

VILLAINS

Some intrigue adventures are driven by the actions of a

single villain, such as a noble plotting the assassination

of a monarch.  Howeve r, a n intrigue adventure can have

multiple villains or no villain at all.

No Villain.  Some intrigue adventures revolve around

the exchange of favors in the absence of a villain. For

this type of adventure, skip steps 1 and 2 of the event

based adventure creation process (the villain and the

villain's actions) and move straight to the adventurers'

goals in step 3. Figure out why the adventurers become

involved in the intrigue, then spend the bulk of your time

creating the NPCs they interact with.

Many Villains.  Some intrigue adventures feature

a whole cast of villains, each with its own goals,

motivations, and methods. The adventurers  might be

drawn into the struggle of a court full  of nobles vying

for the throne in the wake of the king's sudden death,

or could find themselves negotiating the end to a deadly

turf war among thieves' guilds. In this scenario, you'll

spend a lot of time on steps 1 and 2,  developing each of

the m ajor NPCs as a distinct villain with an agenda.

In step 5, you'll  need to develop each villain's reactions

to the potential setbacks they face during the adventure.

However, you don't need to put equal effort into deta iling

the reactions of every villain, since many will likely

echo each other or cancel each other out. Whenever

the adventurers foil  one villain's plans, it might let

another villain's schemes move forward, advancing the

adventure whether the foiled villain reacts or not.

INFLUENCE

Depending on the scenario, you might wa nt to track

the party's influence w ith different NPCs or factions , or

even track influence separately for each character.

One way to handle influence is to treat it like

inspiration. A character gains influe nce in a certain

situation only if you grant it, and bringing influence

into play requires spending it.  Characters can gain

influence by doing favors for  NPCs, advancing the

cause of an organization, or demonstrating their power

and heroism, at your discretion.  As with inspiration,

a character can choose to spend influence to gain

advantage on a roll relevant to that influence.

Another way to handle influence is to treat it like

renown (see chapter 1), allowing characters to gain

renown at court and within various key factions.

~use such an event to grab the players' interest. The

COMPLICATIONS

Sometimes an adventure isn't as straightforward as it

might seem.

MORAL QUANDARIES

If you want to give the characters a crisis that no amount

of spellcasting or swordplay can resolve, add a moral

quandary to  the adventure. A moral quandary is a

problem of conscience for which the adventurers must

make a single choice-but never a simple one.

on the characters. A love interest might demand that

a character turn away from a dangerous quest. A

dear fri end might plead with the characters to spare

the villain's life, to prove that they are better than the

villain. A weak NPC might beg for a chance to win favor

from the characters by undertaking a dangerous but

essential mission .

Honor Quandary. A character is forced to  choose

between victory and a personal oath or code of honor.

A paladin who has sworn the Oath of Virtue might

realize that the clearest path to success lies in deceit

and subterfuge. A Joyal cleric might be tempted to

disobey the orders of his or her faith. If you present

this quandary, be sure to provide an opportunity for a

character to atone for violating his or her oath.

Rescue Quandary. The adventurers must choose

between catching or hurting the villain and saving

innocent lives. For example, the adventurers might

learn that the villain is camped nearby, but they also

learn that another part of the villain's forces is about

to march into a village and burn it to the ground. The

characters must choose between taking out the villain

or protecting innocent villagers, some of whom might be

friends or family members.

Respect Quandary. Two important allies give

conflicting directions or advice to the adventurers.

Perhaps the high priest counsels the characters to

negotiate peace with militaristic elves in the nearby

forest , while a veteran warrior urges them to prove their

strength with a decisive first strike. The adventurers

can't follow both courses, and whichever ally they

choose, the other loses respect for them and might no

longer aid them.

TWISTS

A twist can complicate a story and make it harder for

the characters to complete their goals.

The adventurers have two different goals,  but they

The adventurers  must cooperate with  a known

enemy to  achieve the goal.

The adventurers are  under magica l compulsion

(such  as  a geas spell) to complete the ir goal.

Ally Quandary. The adventurers have a better chance

of achieving their goal with the help of two individuals

whose expertise is all but essential. However, these

two NPCs hate each other and refuse to work together

even if the fate of the world hangs in the balance. The

adventurers must choose the NPC that is most likely to

help them accomplish their goal.

Friend Quandary. An NPC that one or more of the

characters cares about makes an impossible demand

CREATING ENCOUNTERS

:::ncounters are the individual scenes in the larger story

of your adventure.

First and foremost, an encounter should be fun for

~he players. Second, it shouldn't be burden for you to

:un.  Beyond that, a well-crafted encounter usually has

a straightforward objective as well as some connection

to the overarching story of your campaign, building on

the encounters that precede it while foreshadowing

encounters yet to come.

An encounter has one of three possible outcomes:

!he characters succeed, the characters partly succeed,

or the characters faiL  The encounter needs to account

for all three possibilities, and the outcome needs to

have consequences so that the players feel  like their

successes and failures matter.

CHARACTER OBJECTIVES

When players don't know what they're supposed to  do

in a given encounter, anticipation and excitement can

quickly turn to boredom and frustration. A transparent

objective alleviates the risk of players losing interest.

For example, if the overall story of your adventure

involves a quest to deliver a priceless relic to a remote

monastery, each encounter along the way is an

opportunity to introduce a smaller objective that moves

the quest forward. Encounters during the trip might

see the adventurers accosted by enemies determined

to steal the relic, or by monsters that are constantly

threatening the monastery.

Some players create their own objectives, which is to

be expected and encouraged. It is, after all, as much the

players' campaign as yours. For example, a character

might try to bribe enemies rather than figh t them ,

or chase after a fleeing enemy to see where it goes .

Players who ignore objectives will have to deal w ith

the consequences, which is another important facet of

encounter design.

:  -~-. ~?=-~ OE ~~ c-:- ::T =: s

~ ~e io  owing objectiYes can be u  ed as fou ndations

for  encounter  . Although these objectives focus on a

single encounter during an adventu re, using the same

objective in multiple encounters allows you to combine

those encoun ters into a larger obstacle or problem the

adventurers must overcome.

Make Peace. The characters must convince two

opposing groups (or their leaders) to end the conflict

that embroils them. As a complication, the characters

might have enemies on one or both of the opposing

sides, or some other group or individual might be

instigating the conflict to further its own ends.

Protect an NPC or Object. The characters must act

as bodyguards or protect some object in their custody.

As a complication, the NPC under the party's protection

might be cursed, diseased, prone to panic attacks, too

young or too old to fight,  or apt to risk the lives of the

adventurers through dubious decisions. The object the

adventurers have sworn to protect might be sentient,

cursed, or difficult to transport.

Retrieve an Object. The adventurers must gain

possession of a specific object in the area of the

encounter, preferably before combat finishes. As a

complication, enemies might desire the object as much

as the adventurers do, forcing both parties to fight for it.

Run a Gauntlet. The adventurers must pass through

a dangerous area. This objective is similar to retrieving

an object insofar as reaching the exit is a higher priority

than killing opponents in the area. A time limit adds a

complication, as does a decision point that might lead

characters astray. Other complications include traps,

hazards, and monsters.

Sneak In. The adventurers need to move through the

encounter area without making their enemies aware

of their presence. Complications might ensue if they

are detected.

Stop a Ritual. The plots of evil cult leaders,

malevolent warlocks, and powerful fiends often involve

rituals that must be foiled . Characters engaged in

stopping a ritual must typically fight their way through

evil minions before attempting to disrupt the ritual's

powerful magic. As a complication, the ritual might

be close to completion when the characters arrive,

imposing a time limit. Depending on the ritual, its

completion might have immediate consequences as welL

Take Out a Single Target. The villain is surrounded

by minions powerful enough to  kill the adventurers.

The characters can flee and hope to confront the villain

another day,  or they can try to fight their way through

the minions to take out their target. As a complication,

the minions might be innocent creatures under the

villain's controL Killing the villain means breaking that

control, but the adventurers must endure the minions'

attacks until they do.

CREATING A  COMBAT ENCOUNTER

When creating a combat encounter, let your imagination

run wild and build something your players will enjoy.

COMBAT ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY

There are four categories of encounter difficulty.

Easy. An easy encounter doesn't tax the characters'

resources or put them in serious peril. They might lose

a few hit points, but victory is pretty much guaranteed.

Medium. A medium encounter usually has one or

two scary moments for the players, but the characters

should emerge victorious with no casualties. One or

more of them might need to use healing resources.

Hard. A hard encounter could go  badly for the

adventurers. Weaker characters might get taken out

of the fight,  and there's a slim chance that one or more

characters might die.

Deadly. A deadly encounter could be lethal for one or

more player characters. Survival often requires good

tactics and quick thinking, and the party risks defeat.

CHALLENGE  RATING

When  putting together an encounter or adventure, especially

at lower levels,  exercise caution when  using monsters whose

challenge rating is  higher than the party's  average level.  Such

a creature might deal  enough damage with  a single action to

take out adventurers of a  lower level.  For example, an ogre

has a challenge rating of 2,  but it  can  kill  a  l st-level wizard

with  a  single  blow.

In  addition, some monsters  have features that might be

difficult or impossible for  lower-level  characters to overcome.

For example,  a  rakshasa  has a challenge  rating of 13  and  is

immune to spells of 6th  level  and  lower.  Spellcasters of 12th

level  or lower have  no  spells higher than  6th level,  mean ing

that they won't be able to affect the rakshasa with  their

magic,  putting the adventurers at a  serious disadvantage.

Such  an  encounter would  be significantly tougher for the

party than the monster's challenge rating  might suggest.

CHAPTER  3  I C REATI NG  ADVENTURES

EVALUATING  ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY

Use the following method to gauge the difficulty of any

combat encounter.

1. Determine XP Thresholds. First, determine the

experience point (XP) thresholds for each character in

the party. The XP Thresholds by Character Level table

below has four XP thresholds for each character level,

one for each category of encounter difficulty. Use a

character's level to determine his or her XP thresholds.

Repeat this process for every character in the party.

2. Determine the Party's XP Threshold. For each

category of encounter difficulty,  add up the characters'

XP thresholds. This determines the party's XP

threshold. You'll end up with four totals, one for each

category of encounter difficulty.

For example, if your party includes three 3rd-level

characters and one 2nd-level character, the party's

totaled XP thresholds would be as follows:

Easy:  275  XP  (75  + 75 + 75  + 50)

Medium:  550 XP  (150 + 150 + 150 + l 00)

Hard: 825  XP  (225 + 225 + 225 + 150)

Deadly:  l ,400 XP  (400 + 400 + 400 + 200)

Record the totals, because you can use them for every

encounter in your adventure.

3. Total the Monsters' XP. Add up the XP for all of

the monsters in the encounter. Every monster has an XP

value in its stat block.

4. Modify Total XP for Multiple Monsters. If the

encounter includes more than one monster, apply

a multiplier to the monsters' total XP. The more

monsters there are, the more attack rolls you're making

against the characters in a given round, and the more

dangerous the encounter becomes. To correctly gauge

an encounter's  difficulty, multiply the total XP of all

the monsters in the encounter by the value given in the

Encounter Multipliers table.

For example, if an encounter includes four monsters

worth a total of 500 XP, you would multiply the total XP

of the monsters by 2, for an adjusted value of 1,000 XP.

This adjusted value is not what the monsters are worth

in terms of XP; the adjusted value's only purpose is to

help you accurately assess the encounter's difficulty.

When making this calculation, don't count any

monsters whose challenge rating is significantly below

the average challenge rating of the other monsters in the

group unless you think the weak monsters significantly

contribute to the difficulty of the encounter.

5. Compare XP. Compare the monsters' adjusted XP

value to the party's XP thresholds. The closest threshold

that is lower than the adjusted XP value of the monsters

determines the encounter's  difficulty.

?or example, an encounter with one bugbear and

:~ee hobgoblins has an adjusted XP value of 1,000,

:ili ng it a hard encounter for a party of three 3rd-level

:aracters and one 2nd-level character (which has

_ .::.ard encounter threshold of 825 XP and a deadly

ounter threshold of 1,400 XP).

? . .:,.RTY SIZE

.::e  preceding guidelines assume that you have a party

:::~ si sting of three to five  adventurers.

:; the party contains fewer than three characters,

;:;:>ly  the next highest multiplier on the Encounter

~:.Jt ip liers table. For example, apply a multiplier of

_ 5 when the characters fight a single monster, and a

uJtiplier of 5 for groups of fifteen or more monsters.

J  the party contains six or more characters, use the

::xt lowest multiplier on the table. Use a multiplier of

_ 5 fo r a single monster .

For such encounters, treat each discrete part or wave as

a separate encounter for  the purpose of determining its

difficulty.

A party can't benefit from a short rest between parts

of a multipart encounter, so they won't be able to spend

Hit Dice to regain hit points or recover any abilities that

require a short rest to  regain. As a rule, if the adjusted

XP value for the monsters in a multipart encounter is

higher than one-third of the party's expected XP total

for  the adventuring day (see "The Adventuring Day,"

below), the encounter is going to  be tougher than the

sum of its parts.

BUILDING ENCOUNTERS  ON  A  BUDGET

You can build an encounter if you know its desired

difficulty. The party's XP thresholds give you an XP

budget that you can spend on monsters to build easy!.

..

. !  -LTIPART ENCOUNTERS

:e  party doesn't face all at once. For example,

c"N<''"'

_,,

xJ.~

medium , hard, and deadly encounters. Just remember

that groups of monsters eat up more of that budget than

their base XP  values would indicate (see step 4).

For example, using the party from step 2, you can

build a medium encounter by making sure that the

adjusted XP value of the monsters is at least 550 XP

(the party's threshold for a medium encounter) and

no more than 825 XP  (the party's threshold for a hard

encounter). A single monster of challenge rating 3 (such

as a  manticore or owl bear) is worth 700 XP, so that's

one possibility. If you want a pair of monsters, each

one will count for  1.5 times its base XP value. A pair of

dire wolves (worth 200 XP each) have an adjusted XP

value of 600, making them a medium encounter for the

party as well.

To assist with this approach, appendix B presents a

list of all monsters in the Monster Manual organized by

challenge rating.

THE ADVENTURING DAY

Assuming typical adventuring conditions and average

luck, most adventuring parties can handle about six

to eight medium or hard encounters in a day. If the

adventure has more easy encounters, the adventurers

can get through more. If it has more deadly encounters,

they can handle fewer.

In the same way you figure out the difficulty of an

encounter, you can use the XP values of monsters and

other opponents in an adventure as a guideline for how

far the party is likely to progress.

For each character in the party, use the Adventuring

Day XP table to  estimate how much XP that character is

expected to  earn in a day. Add together the values of all

party members to get a total for the party's adventuring

day. This provides a rough estimate of the adjusted XP

value for encounters the party can handle before the

characters will need to take a long rest.

SHORT RESTS

In general, over the course of a full adventuring day, the

party will likely need to take two short rests, about one

third and two-thirds of the way through the day.

MODIFYING ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY

An encounter can be made easier or harder based on

the choice of location and the situation.

:ncrease the difficulty of the encounter by one step

":-am easy to medium, for example) if the characters

2.;e a drawback that their enemies don't. Reduce the

_ - culty by one step if the characters have a benefit that

eir enemies don't. Any additional benefit or drawback

: .:-hes the encounter one step in the appropriate

:  :-ection. If the characters have both a benefit and a

::-awback, the two cancel each other out.

ituational drawbacks include the following:

~he whole party is surprised, and the enemy isn't.

~he enemy has cover, and the party doesn't.

~he characters are unable to  see the enemy.

he characters are taking damage every round from

some environmental effect or magical source, and the

enemy isn't.

The characters are hanging from a rope, in the midst

of scaling a sheer wall or cliff, stuck to the floor,  or oth

erwise in a situation that greatly hinders their mobility

or makes them sitting ducks.

ituational benefits are similar to drawbacks except

'-ar they benefit the characters instead of the enemy.

.:uN COMBAT ENCOUNTERS

:-3e following features can add more fun and suspense

a combat encounter:

Terrain features that pose inherent risks to both the

cha racters and their enemies, such as a frayed rope

bridge and pools of green slime

Terrain features that provide a change of elevation,

uch as pits, stacks of empty crates, ledges,

and balconies

Features that either inspire or force characters and

their enemies to move around, such as chandeliers,

kegs of gunpowder or oil, and whirling blade traps

Enemies in hard-to-reach locations or defensive

positions, so that characters who normally attack at

ra nge are forced to move around the battlefield

Different types of monsters working together

RANDOM  ENCOUNTERS

.~s characters explore a wilderness area or dungeon

omplex, they are bound to encounter the unexpected.

i<.andom encounters are a way to deliver the unexpected.

:hey are usually presented in the form of a table. When

a random encounter occurs, you roll a die and consult

<he table to determine what the party encounters.

Some players and DMs view random encounters in an

adventure as time-wasters, yet well-designed random

encounters can serve a variety of useful purposes:

Create urgency. Adventurers don't tend to  dawdle

if the threat of random encounters is hanging over

their heads. Wanting to avoid wandering monsters

creates a strong incentive to look for a safe place to

rest. (Rolling dice behind the DM screen can often

accomplish this even without an actual encounter.)

Establish atmosphere. The appearance of

thematically linked creatures as random encounters

helps to create a consistent tone and atmosphere

for an adventure. For example, an encounter table

filled with bats, wraiths, giant spiders, and zombies

creates a sense of horror, and tells the adventurers to

prepare for  battle with even more powerful creatures

of the night.

Drain character resources. Random encounters can

drain the party's hit points and spell slots, leaving the

adventurers feeling underpowered and vulnerable.

This creates tension, as players are forced to make

decisions based on the fact that their characters aren't

at full  strength.

Provide assistance. Some random encounters can

benefit  the characters instead of hindering or harming

them. Helpful creatures or NPCs might provide the

adventurers with useful information or assistance

when they need it most.

Add interest. Random encounters can reveal details

about your world. They can foreshadow danger or

provide hints that will help the adventurers prepare

for the encounters to come.

Reinforce campaign themes. Random encounters

can remind the players of the major themes of the

campaign. For example, if your campaign features an

ongoing war between two nations, you might design

random encounter tables to reinforce the ever-present

nature of the conflict. In friendly territory, your tables

might include bedraggled troops returning from bat

tle, refugees fleeing invading forces, heavily guarded

caravans full of weapons, and lone messengers on

horseback riding for the front lines. While charac

ters are in hostile territory, the tables might include

battlefields littered with the recently slain, armies of

evil humanoids on the march, and improvised gib

bets holding the bodies of deserters who tried to flee

the conflict.

Random encounters should never be tiresome to you

or your players. You  don't want the players to feel  as if

they aren't making progress because another random

encounter brings their progress to a halt whenever they

try to move forward. Likewise, you don't want to spend

time distracted by random encounters that add nothing

to  the adventure narrative or that interfere with the

overall pace you're trying to set.

Not every DM likes to use random encounters. You

might find that they distract from your game or are

otherwise causing more trouble than you want. If

random encounters don't work for you, don't use them.

TRIGGERING RANDOM  ENCOUNTERS

Because you want random encounters to  build on the

intended narrative of a game session, not compete with

it, you should choose the placement of those encounters

carefully. Think about a random encounter under any of

the following circumstances:

The players are getting off track and slowing

down the game.

The characters stop for a short or long rest.

The characters are undertaking a long,

uneventful journey.

The characters draw attention to themselves when

they should be keeping a low profile.

CHAPTER  3  I CREATING  ADVENTURES

CRE ATI NG  R AN DO M  E N COUNTER TABLES

Creating your own random encounter tables is

straightforward. Determine what sort of encounters

migh t occur in a given dungeon area, figure out the

likelihood of a particular encounter occurring, then

arrange the results. An "encounter" in this case could be

a single monster or NPC, a group of monsters or NPCs,

a random event (such as an earth tremor or a parade),

or a random discovery (such as a charred corpse or a

message scrawled on a wall).

Assemble Your Encounters. Once you've established

a location through which the adventurers are likely to

pass, be it a wilderness area or dungeon complex, make

a list of creatures that might be found wandering the re.

If you're not s ure which creatures to include, appendix B

has lists of monsters organized by terrain type.

For a sylvan woodland, you might create a table

that includes centaurs, faerie dragons, pixies, sprites,

dryads , satyrs, blink dogs, elks, owlbears, treants, giant

owls, and a unicorn. If elves inhabit the forest , the table

might also include elf druids and elf scouts. Perhaps

gnolls are threatening the woods, so adding gnolls and

hyenas to the table would be a fun surprise for players.

Another fun surprise would be a wandering predator,

such as a displacer beast that likes to hunt blink dogs.

The table could also use a few random encounters of

a less monstrous nature,  such as a grove of burned

trees (the ha ndiwork of the gnolls), an ivy-covered

elven statue, and a plant with glowing berries that turn

creatures invisible when ingested.

When choosing monsters for a random encounter

table, try to  imagine why the monsters would be

encountered outside their lairs. What is each monste r

up to? Is it on patrol? Hunting for food? Searching for

something? Also consider whether a creature is moving

stealthily as it travels through the area.

As with planned encounters, random encounters

are more interesting when they happen in memorable

locations. Outdoors the adventurers might be crossing

a forest clearing when they encounter a unicorn or

be pushing through a dense section of forest when

they come across a nest of spiders. Crossing a desert,

characte rs might discover an oasis haunted by wights or

a rocky outcropping on which a blue dragon perches.

Probabilities. A random encounter table can be

created in a number of ways, ranging from simple (roll

ld6 for one of six possible encounters) to  complicated

(roll percentile dice , modify for  time of day,  a nd cross

index the modified number with the dungeon level). The

sample encounter table presented here uses a range of

2 to 20 (nineteen entries total), generated using 1d12

+ 1d8. The probability curve ensures that encounters

appearing in the middle of the table are more likely to

occur than encounters placed at the beginning or end

of the table. A roll of 2 or 20 is rare (about a  1 percent

chance of either), while each of the rolls  from 9 to  13

occurs a little over 8 percent of the time.

The Sylvan Forest Encounters table is an example

of a random encounter table that implements the ideas

mentioned above. Creature names in bold refer to stat

blocks that appear in the Monster Manual.

\

CHECKING FOR RANDOM  ENCOUNTERS

You  decide when a random encounter happens, or you

roll. Consider checking for a random encounter once

every hour, once every 4 to 8  hours, or once during the

day and once during a long rest-whatever makes the

most sense based on how active the area is.

If you roll, do so with a d20. If the result is 18 or

higher, a random encounter occurs. You then roll on an

appropriate random encounter table to determine what

the adventurers  meet, rerolling if the die result doesn't

make sense given the circumstances.

Random encounter tables might be provided as part

of the adventure you're running, or you can use the

information in this chapter to build your own. Creating

your own tables is the best way to reinforce the themes

and flavor of your home campaign.

Not every run-in with a nother creature counts as

a random e ncounter. Encounter tables don't usually

include rabbits hopping through the und ergrowth,

harmless rats scurrying through dungeon halls, or

average citizens walking through the streets of a city.

Random encounter tables present obstacles and events

that advance the plot, foreshadow important elements or

themes of the adventure, and provide fun  distractions.

CHAPTER  3  I CREATING ADVENTURES







   



RANDOM  ENCOUNTER  CHALLENGE

Random encounters need not be level-appropriate

challenges for the adventurers, but it's considered bad

form to slaughter a party using a random encounter,

since most players consider this ending to be an

unsatisfying one.

Not all random encounters with monsters need

to be resolved through combat. A 1st-level party of

adventurers could have a random encounter with a

young dragon circling above a forest canopy in search

of a quick meal, but the characters should have the

option to hide or bargain for their lives if the dragon

spots them. Similarly, the party might encounter a stone

giant roaming the hills, but it might have no intention

of harming anyone. In fact,  it might shy away from the

party because of its reclusive nature. The giant might

attack only characters who annoy it.

That said, a random encounter table usually includes

hostile (though not necessarily evil) monsters that

are meant to be fought. The following monsters are

considered appropriate combat challenges:

A single monster with a challenge rating equal to or

lower than the party's level.

A group of monsters whose adjusted XP value consti

tutes an easy, medium, or hard challenge for the party,

as determined using the encounter-building guide

lines earlier in this chapter.

CHAPTER 4:  CREATING NONPLAYER  CHARACTERS

NONPLAYER CHARACTER IS  A NY CHARACTER

controlled by the Dungeon Master. NPCs can

be enemies or allies, regular folk or named

monsters. They include the local innkeeper,

the old wizard who lives in the tower on the

outskirts of town, the death knight out to

destroy the kingdom, and the dragon counting gold  in its

cavernous lair.

This chapter shows you how to flesh out non player

characters for your game. For guidelines on generating

monster-like stat blocks for an NPC, see chapter 9,

Dungeon Master's Workshop."

DESIGNING NPCs

_ othing brings your adventures and campaigns to life

better than a cast of well-developed NPCs. That said,

_ ' PCs in your game rarely need as much complexity

a  a well-crafted character in a novel or movie. Most

_ ' PCs are bit players in  the campaign, whereas the

adventurers are the stars.

QuicK NPCs

An  NPC doesn't need combat statistics unless it poses

a rhreat. Moreover, most NPCs need only one or two

qualities to  make them memorable. For example,

:our players will have no trouble remembering the

no-nonsense blacksmith with the tattoo of the black rose

on his right shoulder or the badly dressed bard with the

broken nose.

DETAILED  NPCs

For NPCs who play larger roles in your adventures,

allow more time to flesh  out their histories and

personalities. As you'll see, ten sentences can sum up

he main elements of a memorable NPC, one sentence

or each of the following:

Occupation and history

Appearance

Abilities

Talent

Mannerism

Interactions with others

Useful knowledge

Ideal

Bond

Flaw or secret

Although the material here focuses on humanoid

_ pes, you can adjust details to create monstrous

_ ' PCs as well.

OCCU PATION  AND  HISTORY

In one sentence, describe the NPC's  occupation

and provide a brief historical note that hints at the

cha racter's past. For example, the NPC might have

erved in an army,  been imprisoned for a crime, or

adventured years ago.

APPEARANCE

In one sentence, describe the NPC's most distinctive

physical features. You  can roll on the NPC Appearance

table or choose a feature that suits the character.

could potentially undermine the character-or a secret

that the NPC is trying to hide.

The NPC Flaws and Secrets table provides several

ideas. The backgrounds in the Player's Handbook

can be used to create more detailed flaws.  Player

characters who uncover an NPC's flaw or secret can use

what they've learned to influence the NPC in a social

MoNsTERS  As  NPCs

_ amed monsters that play a significant role in an

adventure deserve the same attention you would give to

a humanoid NPC, with mannerisms as well as ideals,

bonds, flaws , and secrets. If a beholder mastermind

is behind the criminal activities in a city, don't rely

olely on the entry in the Monster Manual to describe

the creature's appearance and personality. Take the

time to  give it a bit of background , a distinctive quirk of

appearance, and especially an ideal, a bond, and a flaw.

As an example, consider the Xanathar, a beholder

that runs extensive criminal operations in the city of

Waterdeep. The Xanathar's spherical body is covered in

leathery flesh with a texture similar to cobblestones. Its

eyes talks are jointed like the legs of an insect, and some

of the stalks have magic rings on them. The Xanathar's

speech is slow and deliberate, and it prefers to turn its

central eye away from creatures it speaks to.  Like all

beholders, it sees other creatures as inferiors, though

it understands the usefulness of its humanoid minions.

The Xanathar uses the sewers beneath Waterdeep to

access virtually any location within or under the city.

The Xanathar's ideal is greed. It craves powerful

magic items and surrounds itself with gold, platinum,

and precious gems. Its bond is to its lair-an elaborate

cavern complex carved out between the twisting sewers

ofWaterdeep, which it inherited from its predecessors

and cherishes above all else. Its flaw is a weakness for

exotic pleasures: finely prepared foods , scented oils, and

rare spices and herbs.

Establishing this information allows you to  play the

Xanathar as more than an ordinary beholder. The

complexities of the creature's characterization create

more memorable interaction and interesting story

possibilities.

NPC  STATISTICS

When you give an NPC game statistics, you have three

main options: giving the NPC only the few statistics it

needs, give the NPC a monster stat block, or give the

NPC a class and levels. The latter two options require a

bit of explanation.

/

USING A  MONSTER S-TAT  BLOCK

Appendix B of the l}f-<:fnster Manual contains statistics

for many gen~;pe-i"fPCs that you can customize as you

ee-fit;"affi!Chapter 9 of this book offers guidelines on

adjusting their statistics and creating a new stat block.

USING  CLASSES  AND  LEVELS

You  can create an NPC just as you would a player

character, using the rules in the Player's Handbook.

You  can even use a character sheet to keep track of the

NPC's vital information.

Class Options. In addition to the class options in the

Player's Handbook , two additional class options are

available for evil player characters and NPCs: the Dea ._

domain for clerics and the oathbreaker for paladins.

Both options are detailed at the end of this chapter.

Equipment. Most NPCs don't need an exhaustive lis

of equipment. An enemy meant to  be faced in combat

requires weapons and armor, plus any treasure the

NPC carries (including magic items that might be used

against the adventurers).

Challenge Rating. An NPC built for combat needs a

challenge rating. Use the rules in chapter 9 to  determin

the NPC's challenge rating, just as you would for a

monster you designed.

NPC  PARTY MEMBERS

NPCs might join the adventuring party because they

want a share of the loot and are willing to  accept

an equal share of the risk, or they might follow the

adventurers because of a bond of loyalty, gratitude,

or love. Such NPCs are controlled by you, or you

can transfer control to the players. Even if a player

controls an NPC, it's up to you to make sure the NPC i

portrayed as a character in his or her own right, not jus

as a servant that the players can manipulate for their

own benefit.

Any NPC that accompanies the adventurers acts as

a party member and earns a full share of experience

points. When determining the difficulty of a combat

encounter (see chapter 3),  make sure to include all NPC

party members.

Low- LEVEL FoLLOWERS

Your campaign might allow player characters to take on

lower-level NPCs as followers. For example, a paladin

might have a 1st-level paladin as a squire, a wizard

might accept a 2nd-level wizard as an apprentice, a

cleric might choose (or be assigned) a 3rd-level cleric as

an acolyte, and a bard might take on a 4th-level bard as

an understudy.

One advantage of allowing lower-level characters to

join the party is that players have backup characters if

their main characters take time off, retire, or die. One

disadvantage is that you and your players have more

party members to account for.

Since lower-level NPC party members receive equal

party shares of XP,  they will gain levels more quickly

than the adventurers (the benefit of studying under such

experienced masters), and might eventually catch up to

them. It also means the adventurers' advancement is

slowed somewhat, as they must share their XP with an

NPC shouldering only part of the adventuring burden.

Powerful monsters that are an appropriate challenge

for  higher-level characters can deal enough damage to

instantly kill or incapacitate a low-level follower.  The

adventurers should expect to spend effort and resources

An NPC whose loyalty score drops to 0 is no longer

loyal to  the party and might part ways with them. A

loyalty score can never drop below 0.

An NPC with a loyalty score of 10 or higher risks life

and limb to  help fellow party members. If the NPC 's

loyalty score is between 1 and 10, its loyalty is tenuous.

An NPC whose loyalty drops to  0 no longer acts in the

party's best interests. The disloyal NPC either leaves the

party (attacking characters who attempt to intervene) or

works in secret to  bring about the party's downfall.

CONTACTS

Contacts are NPCs with close ties to one or more of

the player characters. They don't go on adventures,

but they can provide information, rumors, supplies, or

professional advice, either for free or at a cost. Some

of the backgrounds in  the Player's Handbook suggest

protecting lower-level NPC party members and to

provide healing when this protection fails.

A DVENTURER NPCs

If you don't have enough players to form a full  party,

;ou can use NPCs to fill  out the ranks. These NPCs

hould be the same level as the lowest-level adventurer

in the party and built (either by you or your players)

using the character creation and advancement rules in

the Player's Handbook. It's easiest on you if you let the

playe rs create and run these supporting characters.

Encourage players to roleplay supporting characters

a  true to  the NPCs' personality traits, ideals, bonds,

and flaws as possible, so that they don't come across

automatons. If you don't feel  that an NPC is being

portrayed well , you can take control of the NPC, give

i  to another player, or simply have the NPC leave

~e party.

J  PC supporting characters are easier to play if you

imit their class options. Good candidates for supporting

characters include a cleric with the Life domain , a

ghter with the Champion archetype, a rogue with the

hief archetype, and a wizard specializing in Evocation.

O PTIONAL RULE:  LOYALTY

_oyalty is an optional rule you can use to determine

ow far an NPC party member will go to protect or

-sist the other members of the party (even those

she doesn't particularly like). An  NPC party

ho is abused or ignored is likely to abandon

e party, whereas an NPC who owes a life

ha racters or shares their goals might fight to  the death

:or them. Loyalty can be roleplayed or represented by

this rule.

:..oYALTY ScoRE

_.\n  PC's loyalty is measured on a numerical scale from

to 20.  The NPC's maximum loyalty score is equal

o the highest Charisma score among all adventurers

the party, and its starting loyalty score is half that

umber. If the highest Charisma score changes

;x:rhaps a character dies or leaves the group-adjust the

PC's loyalty score accordingly.

TRA CKING LOYALTY

'eep track of an NPC's loyalty score in secret so that

e players won't know for sure whether an NPC party

~e m ber is loyal or disloyal (even if the NPC is currently

:mder a player's control).

An NPC's loyalty score increases by  ld4 if other party

embers help the NPC achieve a goal tied to its bond.

:... - ewise, an NPC's loyalty score increases by ld4 if

  e  PC is treated particularly well (for example, given

a magic weapon as a gift) or rescued by another party

member. An NPC's loyalty score can never be raised

above its maximum.

When other party members act in a manner that

;-uns counter to the NPC's alignment or bond, reduce

he  PC's loyalty score by  ld4. Reduce the NPC's

nyalty score by 2d4 if the character is abused, misled,

r endangered by other party members for  purely

:  !fish reasons.

CHAPTER  4  C REATING  NONPLAYER  CHARACTERS

93

contacts for beginning adventurers, and characters are

likely to secure more helpful contacts over the course of

their adventuring careers.

A name and a few choice details are all you need

for casual contacts, but take the time to fl esh out a

recurring contact, especially one who might become an

ally or enemy at some point. At the very least, give some

thought to a contact's goals and how those goals are

likely to  come into play.

PATRONS

A patron is a contact who employs the adventurers,

providing help or rewards as well as quests and

adventure hooks. Most of the time, a patron has a vested

interest in the adventurers' success and doesn't need to

be persuaded to  help them.

A patron might be a retired adventurer who seeks

younger heroes to deal with rising threats, or a mayor

who knows that the town guard can't handle a dragon

demanding tribute. A sheriff becomes a patron by

offering a bounty for kobold raiders terrorizing the local

countryside, as does a noble who wants an abandoned

estate cleared of monsters.

HIRELINGS

Adventurers can pay NPCs to provide services

in a variety of circumstances. Information on

hirelings appears in chapter 5, "Equipment,"  of the

Player's Handbook.

Hireling NPCs rarely become important in an

adventure, and most require little development. When

adventurers hire a coach to carry them across town

or need a letter delivered, the driver or messenger

is a hireling, and the adventurers might never even

converse with that NPC or learn his or her name. A

ship captain carrying the adventurers across the sea is

also a hireling, but such a character has the potential

to turn into an ally, a patron, or even an enemy as the

adventure unfolds.

When the adventurers hire an NPC for long-term

work, add the cost of that NPC's services to the

characters' lifestyle expenses. See the "Additional

Expenses" section of chapter 6,  "Between Adventures ,"

for more information.

ExTRAS

Extras are the characters and creatures in the

background that the main characters rarely, if ever,

interact with.

Extras might be elevated to more important roles by

virtue of adventurers singling them out. For instance, a

player might be hooked by a passing reference you make

to a street urchin and try to strike up a conversation

with the youngster. Suddenly, an extra on whom you

placed no importance becomes a central figure in an

improvised roleplaying scene.

Whenever extras are present, be prepared to come up

with names and mannerisms on the fly.  In a pinch, you

can plunder the race-specific character names found  in

chapter 2, "Races," of the Player's Handbook.

VILLAINOUS

CLASS  OPTIONS

You can use the rules in the Player's Handbook to create

NPCs with classes and levels, the same way you create

player characters. The class options below let you create

two specific villainous archetypes: the evil  high priest

and the evil knight or anti paladin.

The Death Domain is an additional domain choice fo r

evil clerics, and the Oathbreaker offers an alternative

path for paladins who fall from grace. A player can

choose one of these options with the your approval.

CLERIC :  DEATH  DOMAIN

The Death domain is concerned with the forces that

cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives

rise to  undead creatures. Deities such as Chemosh,

Myrkul, and WeeJas are patrons of necromancers,

death knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires.

Gods of the Death domain also embody murder (Anubi  .

Bhaal, and Pyremius), pain (Iuz or Loviatar), disease

or poison (Incabulos, Talona, or Morgion), and the

underworld (Hades and He!).

DEATH  DOMAIN  SPELLS

BONUS  PROFICIENCY

When the cleric chooses this domain at 1st level , he or

she gains proficiency with martial weapons.

REAPER

At  1st level, the cleric learns one necromancy cantrip

of his or her choice from any spell list. When the cleric

casts a necromancy cantrip that normally targets only

one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures

within range and within 5 feet of each other.

VILLAIN 's  SECRET WEAKNESS

Finding and exploiting a villain's weakness can be

very gratifying for  players, although a smart villain

tries to conceal its weakness. A lich, for example, has

a phylactery- a  magical receptacle for  its soul- that it

keeps well hidden. Only by destroying the phylactery

can the characters ensure the lich's destruction.

CHAPTER 4  I CREATING  NQ,"PLAYER  CHARACTERS

C HANNEL DIVINITY

An Oathbreaker paladin of 3rd level or higher gains the

:ollowing two Channel Divinity options.

Control Undead. As an action, the paladin targets one

ndead creature he or she can see within 30 feet of him

or her.  The target must make a Wisdom saving throw.

On a failed save, the target must obey the paladin's

commands for the next 24 hours, or until the paladin

uses this Channel Divinity option again. An undead

w hose challenge rating is equ a l to or greater than the

paladin's level is immune to  this effect.

Dreadful Aspect. As an action, the paladin channels

the darkest emotions and focuses them into a  burst of

m agical menace. Each creature of the paladin's  choice

within 30 feet of the paladin must make a Wisdom

s aving throw if it can see the paladin. On a failed save,

the  target is frightened of the paladin for  1 minute. If a

creature frightened by this effect ends its turn more than

30 feet away from the paladin, it can attempt another

Wisdom saving throw to end the effect on it.

AURA  OF  HATE

Starting at 7th level,  the paladin, as well any fiends and

undead within 10 feet of the paladin, gains a  bonus

to melee weapon damage rolls equal to the paladin's

Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). A creature can

benefit from this feature from only one paladin at a  time.

f\t 18th level, the range of this aura increases to  30 feet.

SUPERNATURAL RESISTANCE

At  15th level, the paladin gains resistance to

bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from

nonmagical weapons.

DREAD  LORD

At 20th-level, the paladin can, as an action, surround

himself or herself with an aura of gloom that lasts for  1

minute. The aura reduces any bright light in a  30-foot

radius around the paladin to  dim light. Whenever an

enemy that is frightened by the paladin starts its turn

in the aura, it takes 4dl0 psychic damage. Additionally,

the paladin and creatures he or she chooses in the aura

are draped in deeper shadow. Creatures that rely on

sight have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures

draped in this shadow.

While the aura lasts, the paladin can use a  bonus

action on his or her turn to cause the shadows in the

aura to attack one creature. The paladin makes a

melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits,

the target takes necrotic damage equal to 3d10 +.the

paladin's Charisma modifier.

After activating the aura, the paladin can't do so again

until he or she finishes a long rest.

0ATHBREAKER  ATONEMENT

If you  allow a player to choose the Oath breaker option ,

you  can  later allow the paladin to atone and  become a true

paladin once more.

The  paladin who wishes to  atone  must first  shed  his  or

her evil  alignment and demonstrate this  alignment change

through words and  deeds . Having done so, the  paladin

loses all  Oath breaker features  and  must choose a deity

and a sacred oath.  (With  your permission , the player can

select a different deity or sacred oath than the character

had  previousl y. )  However, the  paladin doesn 't gain the

class featu res specific  to  that sacred  oath  until  he or

she completes so me kind  of dangerous quest or trial , as

determined  by th e  DM .

A paladin  who  breaks  his  or her sacred  oath a second  time

can  become an  oath breaker once  more, but can 't atone.

C HAPTER 5: ADVENTURE  ENVIRONMENTS

ANY D&D ADVENTURES REVOLVE

around a dungeon setting. Dungeons

in  D&D include great halls and tombs,

subterranean monster lairs, labyrinths

riddled with death traps, natural

caverns extending for miles beneath the

urface of the world, and ruined castles.

.  ot every adventure takes place in a dungeon. A

:ilderness trek across the Desert of Desolation or a

arrowing journey into the jungles of the Isle of Dread

can be an exciting adventure in its own right. In the

great outdoors, dragons wheel across the sky in search

f prey, tribes of hobgoblins pour forth from their grim

ortresses to wage war against their neighbors, ogres

plunder farmsteads for food , and monstrous spiders

op from the web-shrouded canopies of trees.

Within a dungeon, adventurers are constrained by

:ails and doors around them , but in the wilderness,

adventurers can travel in almost any direction they

please. Therein lies the key difference between dungeon

and wilderness: it's much easier to predict where the

adventuring party might go in the dungeon because the

ptions are limited- less so in the wilderness.

illages, towns, and cities are cradles of civilization

n a dangerous world, but they too offer opportunities

r adventure. Encounters with monsters might seem

Jlllikely within a city's walls, but urban settings have

eir own villains and perils. Evil, after all, takes many

orms, and urban settings aren't always the safe havens

.hey seem to  be.

Th is chapter provides an overview of these three

environments plus a few unusual environments, taking

:-ou through the process of creating an adventure

ocation, with plenty of random tables to inspire you.

DUNGEONS

me dungeons are old strongholds abandoned by the

lk who built them. Others are natural caves or weird

..airs  carved out by foul  monsters. They attract evil cults,

onster tribes, and reclusive creatures. Dungeons are

o home to ancient treasures: coins, gems, magic

ems, and other valuables hidden away in the darkness,

ften  guarded by traps or jealously kept by the monsters

at have collected them.

B uiLDING  A  DuNGEO N

:hen you set out to create a dungeon, think about its

  tinctive qualities. For example, a dungeon that serves

a hobgoblin stronghold has a different quality from

an ancient temple inhabited by yuan-ti. This section

to life.

Death Trap.  This dungeon is built to eliminate any

creature that dares to enter it. A death trap might guard

the treasure of an insane wizard, or it might be designed

o lure adventurers to their demise for some nefarious

pu rpose, such as to feed souls to a lich's phylactery.

Lair. A lair is a place where monsters live. Typical

airs include ruins and caves.

Maze. A maze is intended to deceive oi- confuse

those who enter it. Some mazes are elaborate obstacles

that protect treasure, while others are gauntlets for

prisoners banished there to  be hunted and devoured by

the monsters within.

Mine. An abandoned mine can quickly become

infested with monsters, while miners who delve too

deep can break through into the Underdark.

Planar Gate. Dungeons built around planar portals

are often  transformed by the planar energy seeping out

th ro ugh those portals.

Stronghold. A stronghold dungeon provides a secure

base of operations for villains and monsters. It is

ually ruled by a powerful individual, such as a wizard ,

:ampire, or dragon, and it is larger and more complex

ilian a simple lair.

Temple or Shrine. This dungeon is consecrated to

a deity or other planar entity. The entity's worshipers

control  the dungeon and conduct their rites there.

Tomb. Tombs are magnets for treasure hunters, as

well  as monsters that hunger for the bones of the dead.

Treasure Vault.  Built to  protect powerful magic items

and great material wealth, treasure vault dungeons are

: eavily guarded by monsters and traps.

HI STORY

n most cases, the original architects of a dungeon are

ong gone, and the question of what happened to them

can help shape the dungeon's current state.

The Dungeon History table notes key events that

can tra nsform a site from its original purpose into a

dungeon for adventurers to  explore.  Particularly old

dungeons can have a history that consists of multiple

events, each of which transformed the site in some way.

DUNGEON  INHABITANTS

After a dungeon's creators depart, anyone or anything

might move in. Intelligent monsters, mindless dungeon

scavengers, predators and prey alike can be drawn

to  dungeons.

The monsters in a dungeon are more than a

collection of random creatures that happen to live

near one another. Fungi, vermin, scavengers, and

predators can coexist in a complex ecology, alongside

intelligent creatures who share living space through

elaborate combinations of domination, negotiation, and

bloodshed.

Characters might be able to sneak into a dungeon,

ally with one faction, or play factions against each other

to  reduce the threat of the more powerful monsters.

For example, in a dungeon inhabited by mind !layers

and their goblinoid thralls, the adventurers might try

to incite the goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears to revolt

against their illithid masters.

DUN GE ON  FACTIONS

A dungeon is sometimes dominated by a single group

of intelligent humanoids, whether a tribe of orcs

that have taken over a cavern complex or a gang of

trolls inhabiting an aboveground ruin. Other times,

particularly in larger dungeons, multiple groups of

creatures share space and compete for resources.

For example, orcs that dwell  in the mines of a ruined

dwarf citadel might skirmish constantly against the

hobgoblins that hold the citadel's upper tiers. Mind

!layers that have established a colony in the lowest

levels of the mines could manipulate and dominate key

hobgoblins in an attempt to wipe out the orcs. And all

the while,  a hidden cell of drow scouts watches and

plots to slay the mind !layers, then enslave whatever

creatures a re left.

It's easy to think of a dungeon as a collection of

encounters , with the adventurers kicking down door

CHAPTER  5  I ADVENTURE  ENVTRONMENTS

101

after door and killing whatever lies beyond. But the

ebb and flow of power between groups in a dungeon

provides plenty of opportunities for more subtle

interaction. Dungeon denizens are used to striking

unlikely alliances, and adventurers are a wild card that

canny monsters seek to exploit.

Intelligent creatures in a dungeon have goals, whether

as simple as short-term survival or as ambitious

as claiming the entire dungeon as the first step in

founding an empire. Such creatures might approach

adventurers with an offer of alliance, hoping to  prevent

the characters from laying waste to their lair and to

secure aid against their enemies. Bring the NPC leaders

of such groups to life as described in chapter 4, fleshing

out their personalities, goals, and ideals. Then use

those elements to shape a response to the arrival of

adventurers in their territory.

DUNGEON ECOLOGY

An inhabited dungeon has its own ecosystem. The

creatures that live there need to eat, drink, breathe, and

sleep, just as creatures in the wilderness do.  Predators

need to be able to seek prey, and intelligent creatures

search for lairs offering the best combination of air,

food , water, and security. Keep these factors in mind

when designing a dungeon you want the players to

believe in. If a dungeon doesn't have some internal logic

to it, adventurers will find it difficult to make reasonable

decisions within that environment.

For example, characters who find  a pool of fresh water

in a dungeon might make the logical assumption that

many of the creatures inhabiting the dungeon come to

that spot to drink. The adventurers might set an ambush

at the pool. Likewise, locked doors- or even doors that

require hands to open-can restrict the movement of

some creatures. If all the doors in a dungeon are closed,

the players might wonder how the carrion crawlers or

stirges they repeatedly encounter manage to survive.

ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY

You might be inclined to increase the encounter

difficulty as the adventurers descend deeper into the

dungeon, as a way to keep the dungeon challenging as

the characters gain levels or to ratchet up the tension.

However, this approach can turn the dungeon into a

grind. A better approach is to include encountets of

varying difficulty throughout. The contrast between easy

and hard encounters, as well as simple and complex

encounters, encourages characters to vary their tactics

and keeps the encounters from seeming too similar.

MAPPING A  DUNGEON

Every dungeon needs a map showing its layout.

The dungeon's location, creator, purpose, history,

and inhabitants should give you a starting point for

designing your dungeon map. If you need further

inspiration, you can find  maps that have been made

freely available for use on the Internet, or even use a

map of a real-world location. Alternatively, you can

borrow a map from a published adventure or randomly

generate a dungeon complex using the tables presented

in appendix A.

A dungeon can range in size from a few chambers

in a  ruined temple to  a huge complex of rooms and

passages ex tending hundreds of feet in all directions.

The adventurers' goal often lies as far from the dungeon

entrance as possible, forcing characters to delve

deeper underground or push farther into the heart of

the complex.

A dungeon is most easily mapped on graph paper,

with each s quare on  the paper representing an area of

10 feet by 10 feet. (If you play with miniatures on a grid,

you might prefer a scale where each square represents 5

feet, or you can subdivide your 10-foot grid into a 5-foot

grid when you draw your maps for combat.) When you

draw your map, keep the following points in  mind:

Asymmetrical rooms and map layouts make a

dungeon less predictable.

Think in three dimensions. Stairs, ramps, platforms,

ledges, balconies, pits, and other changes of elevation

make a dungeon more interesting and make combat

encounters in  those areas more challenging.

Give the dungeon some wear and tear. Unless you

want to stress that the dungeon's builders were

extraordinarily skillful, collapsed passages can be

commonplace, cutting off formerly connected sections

of the dungeon from each other. Past earthquakes

might have opened chasms within a dungeon, splitting

rooms and corridors to make interesting obstacles.

Incorporate natural features into even a constructed

dungeon. An  underground stream might run through

the middle of a dwarven stronghold, causing variation

in the shapes and sizes of rooms and necessitating

features such as bridges and drains.

Add  multiple entrances and exits. Nothing gives the

players a stronger sense of making real decisions than

having multiple ways to  enter a dungeon.

Add secret doors and secret rooms to reward players

who take .the time to search for  them.

If you need help creating a dungeon map from scratch,

see appendix A.

DUNGEON  FEATURES

The atmosphere and physical characteristics of

dungeons vary as widely as their origins. An old crypt

might have stone walls and loose wooden doors, an odor

of decay, and no light other than what adventurers bring

with them. A volcanic lair might have smooth stone

walls hollowed out by past eruptions, doors of magically

reinforced brass, a smell of sulfur, and light provided by

jets of flame in every hall and room.

WALLS

Some dungeons have walls of masonry. Others have

walls of solid rock, hewn with tools to give them a

rough, chiseled look, or worn smooth by the passage of

water or lava. An aboveground dungeon might be made

of wood or composite materials.

Walls are sometimes adorned with murals, frescoes,

bas-reliefs, and lighting fixtures such as sconces or

torch brackets. A few even have secret doors built

into them.

102

CHAPTER  5  I ADVENTURE  ENVlRONMENTS

CATACOMBS



D OORS

Dungeon doorways might be set within plain arches

and lintels. They might be festooned with carvings of

gargoyles or leering faces or engraved with sigils that

reveal clues as to what lies beyond.

Stuck Doors. Dungeon doors often become stuck

when not used frequently. Opening a stuck door requires

a successful Strength check. Chapter 8,  "Running the

Game," provides guidelines for setting the DC.

Locked Doors. Characters who don't have the key

ro a locked door can pick the lock with a successful

Dexterity check (doing so requires thieves' tools and

proficiency in their use).  They can also force the door

with a successful Strength check, smash the door to

pieces by dealing enough damage to it, or use a knock

spell or similar magic. Chapter 8 provides guidelines

for setting the DCs and assigning statistics to doors and

other objects.

Barred Doors. A barred door is similar to a locked

door, except that there's no lock to pick, and the door

can be opened normally from the barred side by using

an action to  lift the bar from its braces.

SECRET DOORS

A secret door is crafted to  blend into the wall that

surrounds it.  Sometimes faint cracks in the wall or scuff

marks on the floor betray the secret door's presence.

Detecting a Secret Door. Use the characters'

passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to determine

whether anyone in the party notices a secret door

without actively searching for it.  Characters can also

find  a secret door by actively searching the location

where the door is hidden and succeeding on a Wisdom

CHAPTER  5  j  ADVENTURE  ENVfRONMENTS

(Perception) check. To set an appropriate DC for  the

check, see chapter 8.

Opening a Secret Door. Once a secret door is

detected, a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check

might be required to  determine how to open it if the

opening mechanism isn't obvious. Set the DC according

to the difficulty guidelines in chapter 8.

If adventurers can't determine how to open a secret

door, breaking it down is always an option. Treat it

as a locked door made of the same material as the

surrounding wall, and use the guidelines in chapter 8 to

determine appropriate DCs or statistics.

CoNCEALED  DooRs

A concealed door is a normal door that is hidden from

view. A secret door is carefully crafted to  blend into its

surrounding surface, whereas a concealed door is most

often hidden by mundane means. It might be covered

by a tapestry, covered with plaster, or (in  the case of

a concealed trapdoor) hidden under a rug. Normally,

no ability check is required to find a concealed door. A

character need only look in the right place or take the

right steps to reveal the door. However, you can use

the characters' passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to

determine whether any of them notices tracks or signs

of a tapestry or rug having been recently disturbed.

PORTCULLISES

A portcullis is a set of vertical bars made of wood or

iron , reinforced with one or more horizontal bands. It

blocks a passage or archway until it is raised up into

the ceiling by a winch and chain. The main benefit of a

portcullis is that it blocks a passage while still a llowing

guards to watch the area beyond and make ranged

attacks or cast spells through it.

Winching a portcullis up or down requires an action.

If a character can't reach the winch (usually because it is

on the other side of the portcullis), lifting the portcullis

or bending its bars far enough apart to pass through

them requires a successful Strength check. The DC

of the check depends on the size and weight of the

portcullis or the thickness of its bars. To  determine an

appropriate DC, see chapter 8.

DARKNESS AND  LIGHT

Darkness is the default cond ition inside an underground

complex or in the interior of aboveground ruins, but an

inhabited dungeon might have light sources.

104

CHAPTER  5  I ADVENTURE  ENVTRONMENTS

In subterranean settlements, even races that have

darkvision use fire  for warmth, cooking, and defense.

But many creatures have no need of warmth or light.

Adventurers must bring their own sources of light into

usty tombs where only undead stand guard, abandoned

;uins teeming with predatory monsters and oozes, and

natural caverns where sightless creatures hunt.

The light of a torch or lantern helps a character

:  e over a short distance, but other creatures can

:  e that light source from far away. Bright light in an

environment of total darkness can be visible for  miles,

j]ough a clear line of sight over such a distance is rare

underground. Even so, adventurers using light sources

JJ a dungeon often attract monsters, just as dungeon

eatures that shed light (from phosphorescent fungi

o the glow of magical portals) can draw adventurers'

anention.

_U R QUALITY

ubterranean tunnels and aboveground ruins are often

enclosed spaces with little airflow. Though it's rare for

a du ngeon to be sealed so tightly that adventurers have

ouble breathing, the atmosphere is often stifling and

oppressive. What's more, odors linger in a dungeon and

can be magnified by the stillness of the atmosphere.

O UNDS

A dungeon's enclosed geography helps channel sound.

The groaning creak of an opening door can echo down

hundreds of feet of passageway. Louder noises such

a  the clanging hammers of a forge or the din of battle

can reverberate through an entire dungeon. Many

creatures that live underground use such sounds as a

"';'\ay  of locating prey, or go on alert at any sound of an

adventuring party's intrusion.

DUNGE ON  HAZARDS

The hazards described here are but a few examples of

the environmental dangers found underground and in

other dark places. Dungeon hazards are functionally

imilar to traps, which are described at the end of

th is chapter.

Detecting a Hazard. No ability check is required

to spot a hazard unless it is hidden. A hazard that

resembles something benign, such as a patch of slime

or mold, can be correctly identified with a successful

Intelligence (Nature) check. Use the guidelines in

chapter 8 to set an appropriate DC for any check made

to s pot or recognize a hazard.

Hazard Severity. To determine a hazard's deadliness

relative to the characters, think of the hazard as a trap

and compare the damage it deals with the party's level

using the Damage Severity by Level table later in the

chapter (the table also appears in chapter 8).

BROWN  MOLD

Brown mold feeds on warmth, drawing heat from

anything around it. A patch of brown mold  typically

covers a  10-foot square, and the temperature within 30

feet of it is always frigid.

When a creature moves to withi n 5 feet of the mold

for  the first  time on a turn or starts its turn there, it

must make a DC  12 Constitution saving throw, taking

22 (4d10) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much

damage on a successful one.

Brown mold is immune to fire,  and any source of fire

brought within 5 feet of a patch causes it to instantly

expand outward in the direction of the fire,  covering a

10-foot-square area (with the source of the fire at the

center of that area). A patch of brown mold exposed to

an effect that deals cold damage is instantly destroyed.

GREEN  SLIME

This acidic slime devours flesh , organic material, and

metal on contact. Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings

to walls, floors , and ceilings in patches.

A patch of green slime covers a 5-foot square, has

blindsight out to a  range of 30 feet, and drops from

walls and ceilings when it detects movement below it.

Beyond that, it has no ability to move. A creature aware

of the slime's presence can avoid being struck by it with

a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise,

the slime can't be avoided as it drops.

A creature that comes into contact with green slime

takes 5 (1d10) acid damage. The creature takes the

damage again at the start of each of its turns until the

slime is scraped off or destroyed. Against wood or

metal , green slime deals 11  (2d10) acid damage each

round, and any nonmagical wood or metal weapon or

tool used to scrape off the slime is effectively destroyed.

Sunlight, any effect that cures disease, and any effect

that deals cold, fire,  or radiant damage destroys a patch

of green slime.

WEBS

Giant spiders weave thick, sticky webs across passages

and at the bottom of pits to snare prey. These web-filled

areas are difficult terrain. Moreover, a creature entering

a webbed area for the first time on a turn or starting its

turn there must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving

throw or become restrained by the webs. A restrained

creature can use its action to try to escape, doing

so with a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) or

Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

Each 10-foot cube of giant webs has AC  10,  15

hit points, vulnerability to fire,  and immunity to

bludgeoning, piercing, and psychic damage.

YELLOW MOLD

Yellow mold grows in dark places, and one patch covers

a 5-foot square. If touched, the mold ejects a cloud of

spores that fills a 10-foot cube originating from  the

mold. Any creature in the area must succeed on a DC

15 Constitution saving throw or take 11  (2d10) poison

damage and become poisoned for  1 minute. While

poisoned in this way,  the creature takes 5 (1d10) poison

damage at the start of each of its turns. The creature

can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its

turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

Sunlight or any amount of fire damage instantly

destroys one patch of yellow mold.

CHAPTER  5  I ADVENTURE  ENVIRONMENTS

105

WILDERNESS

Between the dungeons and settlements of yo ur

campaign world lie meadows, forests, deserts, mountain

ranges, oceans, and other tracts of wilderness waiting

to be traversed. Bringing wilderness areas to life can be

a fun part of your game, both for you and your players.

The following two approaches work particularly well.

TRAVEL- MONTAGE APPROACH

Sometimes the destination is more important than the

journey. If the purpose of a wilderness trek is to get

the characters to where the real adventure happens,

gloss over the wilderness trek without checking for

encounters along the way. Just as movies use travel

montages to convey long and arduous journeys in a

matter of seconds, you can use a few sentences of

descriptive text to paint a picture of a wilderness trek in

your players' minds before moving on.

Describe the journey as vividly as you  like, but keep

the forward momentum. "You walk for several miles

and encounter nothing of interest" is okay, but far less

evocative and memorable than, "A light rain dampens

the rolling plains as you travel north. Around midday,

you break for lunch under a lonely tree. There, the rogue

finds a small rock that looks like a grinning face , but

otherwise you encounter nothing out of the ordinary."

The trick is to focus on a few details that reinforce the

desired mood rather than describe everything down to

the last blade of grass.

Call attention to  unusual terrain features: a waterfall,

a rocky outcropping that offers a breathtaking view over

the tops of the surrounding trees, an area where the

forest has burned or been cut down, and so on. Also

describe notable smells and sounds, such as the roar of

a faraway monster, the stench of burned wood, or the

sweet aroma of flowers in an elven forest.

In addition to evocative language, visual aids can help

set the scene for the characters' travels. Image searches

on the Internet can lead you to  breathtaking landscapes

(in fact , that's a good phrase to search for)  both real and

fantastical. As striking as real-world scenery can be,

wilderness travel can be used to remind the players that

their characters are in a fantasy world. Once in a while,

spice up your descriptions with some truly magical

element. A forest might be home to tiny dragonets

instead of birds, or its trees might be festooned with

giant webs or have eerie, green-glowing sap. Use these

elements sparingly; landscapes that are too alien can

break your players' sense of immersion in the world. A

single fantastic element within an otherwise realistic

and memorable landscape is enough.

Use the landscape to set the mood and tone for your

adventure. In one forest , close-set trees shroud all

light and seem to watch the adventurers as they pass.

In another, sunlight streams through the leaves above

and flower-laden vines twine up every trunk. Signs

of corruption-rotting wood, foul-smelling water, and

rocks covered with slimy brown moss- can be a signal

that the adventurers are drawing close to the site of evil

power that is their destination or can provide clues to

the nature of the threats to  be found there.

CHAPTER  5  I ADVENTURE  ENVIRONMENTS

S pecific wilderness locations might have their own

special feat ures. For example, the Spirit Forest and

the Spiderhaunt Woods might feature different kinds

of trees, diffe rent kinds of flora  and fauna, different

weather. a nd different random encounter tables.

Fina lly,  a wilderness trek can be enhanced by calling

attention to the weather. "You spend the next three

days crossing the swamp" sounds less harrowing than,

"You  spend the next three days trudging through knee

deep mud- the first two days and nights in  the pouring

rain, and then another day under the beating sun, with

swarms of hungry insects feasting on your blood."

HouR-BY- HouR APPROACH

Sometimes the journey deserves as much time and

attention as the destination. If wilderness travel feature

prominently in your adventure and isn't something you

want to gloss over, you will  need more than a descriptive

overview to  bring a long and harrowing journey to  life;

you'll need to know the party's marching order and have

encounters at the ready.

Let your players determine the party's  marching

order (see the Player's Handbook for  more information).

Characters in the front rank are likely to be the first to

notice landmarks and terrain features , as well as the

ones responsible for navigating. Characters in the back

rank are usually responsible for making sure that the

party isn't being followed.  Encourage characters in  the

middle ranks to do something other than blindly trudge

along behind the front-rank characters. The Player's

Handbook suggests activities such as mapmaking and

foraging for food.

Wilderness journeys typically feature a combination of

planned encounters (encounters that you prepare ahead

of time) and random encounters (encounters determined

by rolling on a table). A planned encounter might need a

m~p of the location where the encounter is set to occur,

such as a ruin, a bridge spanning a gorge, or some other

memorable location. Random encounters tend to be

less location-specific. The fewer planned encounters

you have, the more you'll  need to  rely on random

encounters to keep the journey interesting. See chapter

3 for guidelines on creating your own random encounter

tables and when to check for random encounters.

A good way to keep wilderness encounters from

becoming stale is to make sure they don't all start and

end the same way.  In other words, if the wilderness

is your stage and your adventure is the play or movie,

think of each wilderness encounter as its own scene,

and try to stage each one in a slightly different way to

keep your players' interest. If one encounter comes

at the adventurers from the front , the next one might

come at them from above or behind. If an encounter

features stealthy monsters, a character tending to the

party's pack animals might get the first indication that

monsters are near when a pony whickers nervously. If

an encounter features loud monsters, the party might

have the option to  hide or set an ambush. One group of

monsters might attack the party on sight, and another

might allow safe passage for food.

Reward characters for searching while they travel by

providing things for  them to  find.  Broken statues, tracks,

ro6 r

abandoned campsites, and other finds can add flavor to

your world, foreshadow future encounters or events, or

provide hooks for further adventures.

A wilderness journey might take multiple sessions to

play out. That said, if the wilderness journey includes

long periods with no encounters, use the travel-montage

approach to bridge gaps between encounters.

MAPPING A  WILDERNESS

In contrast to a dungeon , an outdoor setting presents

seemingly limitless options. The adventurers can move

in any direction over a trackless desert or an open

grassland, so how do you as the DM deal with all the

possible locations and events that might make up a

wilderness campaign? What if you design an encounter

in a desert oasis, but the characters miss the oasis

because they wander off course? How do you avoid

creating a boring play session of uninterrupted slogging

across a rocky wasteland?

One solution is to think of an outdoor setting in  the

same way you think about a dungeon. Even the most

wide-open terrain presents clear pathways. Roads

seldom run straight because they follow the contours

of the land, finding the most level or otherwise easiest

routes across uneven ground. Valleys and ridges

channel travel in certain directions. Mountain ranges

present forbidding barriers traversed only by remote

passes. Even the most trackless desert reveals favored

routes, where explorers and caravan drivers have

discovered areas of wind-blasted rock that are easier to

traverse than shifting sand.

If the party veers off track, you might be able to

relocate one or more of your planned encounters

elsewhere on the map to ensure that the time spent

preparing those encounters doesn't go to waste.

Chapter 1 discusses the basics of creating a

wilderness map at three different scales to help

you design your world and the starting area of your

campaign. Especially when you get down to province

scale (1  hex= 1 mile), think about paths of travel- roads,

passes, ridges and valleys, and so on-that can guide

character movement across your map.

MOVEMENT  ON THE  MAP

Narrate wilderness travel at a level of detail appropriate

to the map you're using. If you're tracking hour-by-hour

movement on a province-scale map (1  hex= 1 mile),

you can describe each hamlet the adventurers pass.

At this scale, you can assume that the characters find

a noteworthy location when they enter its hex unl ~ ss

the site is specifically hidden. The characters might not

walk directly up to the front door of a ruined castle when

they enter a hex, but they can find  old paths, outlying

ruins, and other signs of its presence in the area.

If you're tracking a journey of several days on a

kingdom-scale map (1  hex= 6 miles), don't bother with

details too small to appear on your map. It's enough

for  the players to  know that on the third day of their

journey, they cross a river and the land starts rising

before them, and that they reach the mountain pass two

days later.

CHAPTER 5  I ADVENTURE  ENVIRONMENTS

WILDERNESS  FEATURES

o wilderness map is complete without a few

settlements, strongholds, ruins, and other sites worthy

of discovery.  A dozen such locations scattered over an

a rea roughly 50 miles across is a good start.

Mo  STER LAIRS

A wilderness area approximately 50 miles across can

support roughly a half-dozen monster lairs, but probably

no more than one apex predator such as a dragon.

If you expect the characters to explore a monster's

lair, you'll  need to find  or create an appropriate map for

the lair and stock the lair as you would a dungeon .

MONUMENTS

In places where civilization rules or once ruled ,

adventurers might find  monuments built to honor great

leaders, gods, and cultures. Use the Monuments table

for  inspiration, or randomly roll to determine what

monument the adventurers stumble upon.

RUINS

Crumbling towers, ancient temples , and razed cities

are perfect sites for adventures. Additionally, noting the

existence of an old, crumbling wall that runs alongside a

road, a sagging stone windmill on a  hilltop, or a jumble

of standing stones can add texture to your wilderness.

SETTLEMENTS

Settlements exist in places where food , water, farmland ,

and building materials are abundant. A civilized

province roughly 50 miles across might have one city, a

few rural towns, and a scattering of villages and trading

posts. An uncivilized area might have a single trading

post that stands at the edge of a wild frontier, but no

larger settlements.

In addition to settlements, a province might contain

ruined villages and towns that are either abandoned or

serve as lairs for  marauding bandits and monsters.

STRONGHOLDS

Strongholds provide the local population with protection

in times of trouble. The number of strongholds in an

area depends on the dominant society, the population ,

the strategic importance or vulnerability of the region,

and the wealth of the land.

WEIRD  LOCALES

Weird locales make the fantastic and the supernatural

an intrinsic part of your wilderness adventures.

CHAPTER  5  I ADVENTURE  ENVIRONMENTS

EXTREME  COLD

Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees

Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to  the cold must succeed

on a DC  10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each

hour or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with

resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically

succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing

cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and

creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.

EXTREME  HEAT

When the temperature is at or above  100 degrees

Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the heat and

without access to drinkable water must succeed on

a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour

or gain one level of exhaustion. The DC is 5 for  the

first hour and increases by  1 for each additional hour.

Creatures wearing medium or heavy armor, or who are

clad in heavy clothing, have disadvantage on the saving

throw. Creatures with resistance or immunity to fire

damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as

do creatures naturally adapted to hot climates.

STRONG WIND

A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon

attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on

hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames ,

disperses fog,  and makes flying  by nonmagical means

nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind

must land at the end of its turn or fall.

A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that

imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks

that rely on sight.

HEAVY PRECIPITATION

Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy

snowfall is lightly obscured, and creatures in  the area

have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that

rely on sight. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames

and imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception)

checks that rely on hearing.

HIGH ALTITUDE

-------------~------------------

Traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above

sea level is taxing for a creature that needs to  breathe,

because of the reduced amount of oxygen in the

air. Each hour such a creature spends traveling at

high altitude counts as 2 hours for the purpose of

determining how long that creature can travel.

Breathing creatures can become acclimated to a high

altitude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation.

Breathing creatures can't become acclimated to

elevations above 20,000 feet unless they are native to

such environments.

WILDERNESS  HAZARDS

This section describes a few examples of hazards that

adventurers might encounter in the wilderness.

Some hazards, such as slippery ice and razorvine,

require no ability check to spot. Others, such as

defiled ground, are undetectable by normal senses.

T he other hazards presented here can be identified

with a successful Intelligence (Nature) check. Use the

guidelines in chapter 8 to set an appropriate DC for any

check made to spot or recognize a  hazard.

DESE CRATED  GROUND

Some cemeteries and catacombs are imbued with the

unseen traces of ancient evil. An area of desecrated

ground can be any size, and a detect evil and good spell

cast within range reveals its presence.

Undead standing on desecrated ground have

adva ntage on all saving throws.

A vial of holy water purifies a  10-foot-square area of

desecrated ground when sprinkled on it, and a hallow

spell  purifies desecrated ground within its area.

FRIGID WATER

A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a

number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before

suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent

in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a

DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of

exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to

cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw.

as do creatures that are naturally adapted to  living in

ice-cold water.

QUICKSAND

A quicksand pit covers the ground in roughly a  10-foot

square area and is usually 10 feet deep. When a creature

enters the area, it sinks ld4 + 1 feet into the quicksand

and becomes restrained. At  the start of each of the

creature's turns, it sinks another 1d4 feet. As long as

the creature isn't completely submerged in quicksand,

it can escape by using its action and succeeding on a

Strength check. The DC is 10 plus the number of feet

the creature has sunk into the quicksand. A creature

that is completely submerged in  quicksand can't breathe

(see the suffocation rules in the Player's Handbook).

A creature can pull another creature within its reach

out of a quicksand pit by using its action and succeeding

on a Strength check. The DC is 5 plus the number of

feet the target creature has sunk into the quicksand.

RAZORVINE

Razorvine is a plant that grows in wild tangles and

hedges. It also clings to the sides of buildings and

other surfaces as ivy does. A 10-foot-high, 10-foot-wide,

5-foot-thick wall or hedge of razorvine has AC  11,  25

hit points, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and

psychic damage.

When a creature comes into direct contact with

razorvine for the first time on a turn, the creature

must succeed on a DC  10 Dexterity saving throw or

take 5 (1d10) slashing damage from the razorvine's

bladelike thorns.

SLIPPERY IcE

Slippery ice is difficult terrain. When a creature moves

onto slippery ice for the first time on a turn, it must

succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or

fall  prone.

no

CHAPTER  5  I ADVENTURE  ENVJRONMENTS

THIN leE

Thin ice has a weight tolerance of 3d10 x 10 pounds per

10-foot-square area. Whenever the total weight on an

area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice in that area

breaks. All creatures on broken ice fall  through.

FORAGING

Characters can gather food  and water as the party

travels at a normal or slow pace. A foraging character

makes a Wisdom (Survival) check whenever you call for

it,  with the DC determined by the abundance of food and

water in the region.

If multiple characters forage, each character makes

on a failed check. On a successful check, roll  ld6 +the

character's Wisdom modifier to determine how much

fo od (in pounds) the character finds,  then repeat the roll

fo r water (in gallons).

FooD AND WATER

The food and water requirements noted in the Player's

Handbook are for characters. Horses and other

creatures require different quantities of food and water

per day based on their size. Water needs are doubled if

the weather is hot.

Unless they are following a path, or something like it,

adventurers traveling in the wilderness run the risk of

becoming lost. The party's navigator makes a Wisdom

(Survival) check when you decide it's appropriate,

against a DC determined by the prevailing terrain, as

shown on the Wilderness Navigation table. If the party

is moving at a slow pace, the navigator gains a +5 bonus

to the check, a nd a fast pace imposes a - 5 penalty. If the

party has an accurate map of the region or can see the

sun or stars, the navigator has advantage on the check.

If the Wisdom (Survival) check succeeds, the party

travels in the desired direction without becoming lost.

trying to get back on course.

murder, take out a gang of wererats or doppelgangers,

or protect a settlement under siege.

When creating a settlement for your campaign, focus

on the locations that are most relevant to the advent ure.

Don't worry about naming every street and identifying

the inhabitants of every building; that way lies madness.

MAPPING A  SETTLEMENT

When you draw a map for a settlement in your game,

don't worry about the placement of every building, and

concentrate instead on the major features.

For a village, sketch out the roads, including trade

routes leading beyond the village and roads that connect

outlying farms to the village center. Note the location of

the village center. If the adventurers visit specific places

in the village, mark those spots on your map.

For towns and cities, note major roads and waterways

as well as surrounding terrain. Outline the walls

and mark the locations of features you know will be

important: the lord's keep, significant temples, and

the like. For cities, add internal walls and think about

the personality of each ward. Give the wards names

reflecting their personalities, which also identify

the kinds of trades that dominate the neighborhood

(Tannery Square, Temple Row), a geographical

characteristic (Hilltop, Riverside), or a dominant site

(the Lords' Quarter).

URBAN  ENCOUNTERS

Although they hold the promise of safety, cities and

towns can be just as dangerous as the darkest dungeon.

Evil hides in plain sight or in dark corners. Sewers,

shadowy alleys, slums, smoke-filled taverns, dilapidated

tenements, and crowded marketplaces can quickly turn

into battlegrounds. On top of that, adventurers must

learn to behave themselves, lest they attract unwanted

attention from  local authorities.



That said, characters who don't go looking for trouble

can take advantage of all the benefits that a settlement

has to offer.

LAW AND  ORDER

Whether a settlement has a police force depends on its

size and nature. A lawful , orderly city might have a city

watch to  maintain order and a trained militia to  defend

its walls, and a frontier town might rely on adventurers

or its citizenry to apprehend criminals and fend  off

attackers.

TRIALS

In most settlements, trials are overseen by magistrates

or local lords. Some trials are argued, with the

conflicting parties or their advocates presenting

CHAPTER  5  I ADVENTURE  ENVIRONMENTS

precedent and evidence until the judge makes

a decision . with or without the aid of spells or

interrogation. Others are decided with a trial by ordeal

or trial by combat. If the evidence against the accused

is overwhelming, a magistrate or local lord can forgo a

trial and skip right to the sentencing.

SE NTENC ES

A settlement might have a jail to hold accused criminals

awaiting trial, but few settlements have prisons to

incarcerate convicted criminals. A person found guilty

of a crime is usually fined , condemned to forced labor

for a period of several months or years, exiled, or

executed, depending on the magnitude of the crime.

RANDOM  URBAN  ENCOUNTERS

The Random Urban Encounters table is useful for

city- and town-based adventures. Check for a random

encounter at least once per day, and once at night if

the characters are out and about. Reroll the result if it

doesn't make sense given the time of day.

Animals on the Loose. The characters see one or

more unexpected animals loose in the street. This

challenge could be anything from a pack of baboons to

an escaped circus bear, tiger, or elephant.

Announcement. A herald, town crier, mad person,

or other individual makes an announcement on a

street corner for all to hear. The announcement might

foreshadow some upcoming event (such as a public

execution), communicate important information to the

general masses (such as a new royal decree), or convey a

dire omen or warning.

Brawl. A brawl erupts near the adventurers. It could

be a tavern brawl; a battle between rival factions,

families, or gangs in the city; or a struggle between

city guards and criminals. The characters could be

/

witnesses, hit by stray arrow fire,  or mistaken for

members of one group and attacked by the other.

Bullies. The characters witness ld4 + 2 bullies

harassing an out-of-towner (use the commoner statistics

in the Monster Manual for all of them). A bully flees as

soon as he or she takes any amount of damage.

Companion. One or more characters are approached

by a local who takes a friendly interest in the party's

activities. As a twist, the would-be companion might be

a spy sent to gather information on the adventurers.

Contest. The adventurers are drawn into an

impromptu contest-anything from an intellectual test

to a drinking competition-or witness a duel.

Corpse. The adventurers find  a humanoid corpse.

Draft. The characters are drafted by a member of the

city or town watch, who needs their help to deal with an

immediate problem. As a twist, the member of the watch

might be a disguised criminal trying to lure the party

into an ambush (use the thug statistics in the Monster

Manual for the criminal and his or her cohorts).

Drunk. A tipsy drunk staggers toward a random party

member, mistaking him or her for someone else.

Fire. A fire breaks out, and the characters have a

chance to help put out the flames before it spreads.

Found Trinket. The characters find  a random trinket.

You  can determine the trinket by rolling on the Trinkets

table in the Player's Handbook.

Guard Harassment. The adventurers are cornered

by ld4 + 1 guards eager to throw their weight around. If

threatened, the guards call out for help and might attract

the attention of other guards or citizens nearby.

Pickpocket. A thief (use the spy statistics in the

Monster Manual) tries to steal from a random character.

Characters whose passive Wisdom (Perception) scores

are equal to or greater than the thief's Dexterity (Sleight

of Hand) check total catch the theft in progress.

Procession. The adventurers encounter a group of

citizens either parading in celebration or forming a

funeral procession.

Protest. The adventurers see a group of citizens

peacefully protesting a new law or decree. A handful of

guards maintain order.

Runaway Cart. A team of horses pulling a wagon

races through the city streets. The adventurers must

avoid the horses. If they stop the wagon, the owner (who

is running behind the cart) is grateful.

Shady Transaction. The characters witness a shady

transaction between two cloaked figures.

Spectacle. The characters witness a form of public

entertainment, such as a talented bard's impersonation

of a royal personage, a street circus, a puppet show,

a flashy magic act, a royal visit, or a public execution.

Urchin. A street urchin gloms onto the adventurers

and follows them around until frightened off.

UNUSUAL ENVIRONMENTS

Traveling through the wilderness doesn't always mean

an overland trek. Adventurers might ply the open sea in

a caravel or an elemental-powered galleon, soar through

the air on hippogriffs or a carpet of flying , or ride giant

sea horses to coral palaces deep beneath the sea.

SwiMMING

Unless aided by magic, a character can't swim for a

full 8 hours per day. After each hour of swimming, a

character must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving

throw or gain one level of exhaustion.

A creature that has a swimming speed-including a

character with a ring of swimming or similar magic

can swim all day without penalty and uses the normal

forced march rules in the Player's Handbook.

Swimming through deep water is similar to traveling

at high altitudes, because of the water's pressure and

cold temperature. For a creature without a swimming

speed, each hour spent swimming at a depth greater

than 100 feet counts as 2 hours for the purpose of

u6

CHAPTER  5  I ADVENTURE  ENVIRONMENTS

determining exhaustion. Swimming for an hour at a

depth greater than 200 feet counts as 4 hours.

N DERWATER VISIBILITY

\'isibility underwater depends on water clarity and the

available light. Unless the characters have light sources,

use the Underwater Encounter Distance table to

determine the distance at which characters underwater

become aware of a possible encounter.

THE  SEA

Characters can row a boat for 8 hours per day, or can

row longer at the risk of exhaustion (as per the rules for

a forced march in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook). A

fully crewed sailing vessel can sail all day, assuming its

sailors work in shifts.

NAVIGATION

Seagoing vessels stay close to shore when they can,

because navigation is easier when landmarks are

visible. As long as a ship is within sight of land, there

is no chance of the vessel becoming lost. Otherwise, a

ship's navigator must rely on dead reckoning (tracking

0

the direction and distance of the ship's travel) or the sun

and the stars.

Use the Wilderness Navigation table earlier in this

chapter to determine whether a ship veers off course.

RANDOM  ENCOUNTERS AT  SEA

You can check for random encounters at sea as often

as you would check for them on land (see chapter 3 for

more information). The Random Encounters at Sea

table presents a number of options and ideas.

SHIPWRECKS

A shipwreck is  a plot device that can  be  used  sparingly to

great effect,  particularly if you  want the characters to  be

washed  ashore on  some  monster-infested  island  or (in the

case  of an  airship)  dropped  in  the  middle of some exotic

land. There aren't rules  for determining when  a shipwreck

happens;  it happens when  you  want or need  it to happen.

Even  the strongest seafaring ship can  founder in  a storm,

run  aground  on  rocks  or reefs , sink during a pirate attack,  or

be dragged  underwater by a sea  monster. A storm orhungry

dragon can  lay waste to an  airship just as  easily. A shipwreck

has  the  potential to change the direction of a campaign . It

isn't,  however, a particularly good way to kill  off characters  or

end  a campaign .

If you  and  your campaign  conspire to wreck a ship on

which the characters  are traveling,  it is  assumed that the

characters  survive with the equipment they were wearing or

carrying still  in  their possession. The fate of any  N PCs  and

cargo  aboard the wrecked  ship is  entirely up to you.

WEATHER AT  S EA

Use the Weather table earlier in this chapter when

checking for weather at sea.

If weather conditions indicate both a strong wind

and heavy rain, they combine to  create a storm with

high waves. A crew caught in a storm loses sight of all

landmarks (unless there's a lighthouse or other bright

feature), and ability checks made to navigate during the

storm have disadvantage.

THE  SKY

Flying characters can move from one place to another in

a relatively straight line, ignoring terrain and monsters

that can't fly  or that lack ranged attacks.

Flying by spell or magic item works the same as

travel on foot, as described in the Player's Handbook. A

creature that serves as a flying mount must rest 1 hour

for every 3 hours it flies , and it can't fly  for  more than

9 hours per day.  Thus, characters mounted on griffons

(which have a flying speed of 80 feet) can travel at 8

miles per hour, covering 72  miles over 9 hours with two

1-hour-long rests over the course of the day.  Mounts that

don't tire (such as a flying construct) aren't subject to

this limitation.

In a dead calm (no wind), ships can't move under sail

and must be rowed. A ship sailing against a strong wind

moves at half speed.

ISIBILITY

A relatively calm sea offers great visibility. From a

crow's nest, a lookout can spot another ship or a

oastline up to  10 miles away, assuming clear skies.

Overcast skies reduce that distance by half.  Rain and

og reduce visibility just as they do on land.

OWNING A  SHIP

At some point in your campaign, the adventurers

might gain custody of a ship. They might purchase or

capture one or receive one to carry out a  mission. It's

up to you whether a ship is available for purchase, and

you have the power to deprive the adventurers of a

hip at any time should it become a  nuisance (see the

Shipwrecks" sidebar).

Crew. A ship needs a crew of skilled hirelings to

"unction. As per the Player 's Handbook, one skilled

hireling costs at least 2 gp per day. The minimum

number of ski lled hirelings needed to crew a ship

depends on the type of vessel , as shown in the Airborne

and Waterborne Vehicles table.

You can track the loyalty of individual crew members

or the crew as a whole using the optional loyalty rules

in chapter 4. If at least half the crew becomes disloyal

during a voyage, the crew turns hostile and stages a

mutiny. If the ship is berthed , disloyal crew members

leave the ship and never return.

Passengers. The table indicates the number of Small

and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate.

Accommodations consist of shared hammocks in tight

quarters. A ship outfitted with private accommodations

can carry one-fifth as many passengers.

A passenger is usually expected to pay 5 sp per day

for a  hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A

mall  private cabin usually costs 2 gp per day.

Cargo. The table indicates  the maximum tonnage

each kind of ship can carry.

Damage Threshold. A ship has immunity to all

damage unless it takes an amount of damage equal to or

greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes

damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or

exceed the damage threshold is considered superficial

and doesn't reduce the ship's hit points.

Ship Repair. Repairs to a damaged ship can be made

.  hile the vessel is berthed.  Repairing 1 hit point of

amage requires 1 day and costs 20 gp for materials

and labor.









As adventurers travel through the air,

result that indicates a non-flying monster, unless the

characters are flying close enough to the ground to be

targeted by non-flying creatures making ranged attacks.

Characters have normal chances to spot creatures on

the ground and can decide whether to engage them.

TRAPS

Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step

in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything

blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The

seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave

entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes

through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop

on travelers who pass underneath. In the D&D game,

unwary adventurers can fall  to  their deaths, be burned

alive, or fall  under a fusillade of poisoned darts.

A trap can be either mechanical or magical in

nature. Mechanical traps include pits, arrow

traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling

blades, and anything else that depends on

a mechanism to operate. Magic traps are either

magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device

traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps

are spells such as glyph of warding and symbol that

function as traps.

CHAPTER  5  I ADVENTURE  ENVIRONMENTS

SIN PLAY

When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know

how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the

possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to

disable or avoid it.

TRIGGERING A  TRAP

Most traps are triggered when a creature goes

somewhere or touches something that the trap's creator

wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on

a pressure plate or a false section of floor,  pulling a trip

wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a

lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature

enters an area or touches an object. Some magic

traps (such as the glyph of warding spell) have more

complicated trigger conditions, including a password

that prevents the trap from activating.

DETECTING AND  DISABLING A  TRAP

Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful

inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone

that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off

a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which

jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something

that points to a trap's presence.

A trap's description specifies the checks and DCs

needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character

actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom

(Perception) check against the trap's DC. You can

also compare the DC to detect the trap with each

character's passive Wisdom (Perception) score to

determine whether anyone in the party notices the

trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before

triggering it,  they might be able to  disarm it,  either

permanently or long enough to move past it. You might

call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a

character to  deduce what needs to  be done, followed

by a Dexterity check using thieves' tools to perform the

necessary sabotage.

Any character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana)

check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to

any other checks noted in the trap's description. The

DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In

addition, dispel magic has a chance of disabling most

magic traps. A magic trap's description provides the DC

for the ability check made when you use dispel magic.

In most cases, a trap's description is clear enough

that you can adjudicate whether a character's actions

locate or foil  the trap. As with many situations, you

shouldn't allow die rolling to override clever play and

good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the

trap's description to determine what happens. No trap's

design can anticipate every possible action that the

characters might attempt.

You should allow a character to discover a trap

without making an ability check if an action would

clearly reveal the trap's presence. For example, if a

character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate,

rhe character has found  the trigger and no check

is required.

Foiling traps can be a little more complicated.

Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened

without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a

mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward

anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and

making a few checks, the characters are still unsure

if it's trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they

prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at

a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still

rriggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into

the shield.

Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow

them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters

that place traps in or around their lairs need ways

ro  get past those traps without harming themselves.

uch traps might have hidden levers that disable their

triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that

goes around the trap.

T RAP  EFFECTS

The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to

deadly,  making use of elements such as arrows,

pi kes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire,

and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple

elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature

unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap's description

specifies what happens when it is triggered.

The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to  resist its

effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on

the trap's severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack

Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table

for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.

A trap intended to be a setback is unlikely to kill

or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels,

whereas a dangerous trap is likely to seriously injure

(and potentially kill) characters of the indicated

levels. A deadly trap is likely to kill characters of the

indicated levels.

COMPLEX TRAPS

Complex traps work like standard traps, except once

activated they execute a series of actions each round. A

complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap

into something more like a combat encounter.

When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The

trap's description includes an initiative bonus. On its

turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It

might make successive attacks against intruders, create

APTER  5  I ADVENTURE  ENVIRONMENTS

l~l

an effect that changes over time. or otherwi  e  produce a

dynamic cha llenge.  Otherw ise, the complex trap can be

detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.

For example, a  trap that causes a room to slowly

flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap's turn,

the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is

completely flooded .

SAMPLE TRAPS

The magical and mechanical traps presented here vary

in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order.

COLLAPSING ROOF

Mechanical trap

This trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports

keeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place.

The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches

between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip

wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using

thieves' tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A

character without thieves' tools can attempt this check

with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged

tool.  On a failed check, the trap triggers.

Anyone who inspects the beams can easily determine

that they are merely wedged in place. As an action,

a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap

to trigger.

The ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair,

and anyone who can see it can tell that it's in danger

of collapse.

When the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling

collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable

section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving

throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed

save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once

the trap is \riggered, the floor of the area is filled with

rubble and becomes difficult terrain.

The DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as

faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or

other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such

as detect magic, reveals an aura of evocation magic

around the statue.

The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of

weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the

statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire.  Each creature

in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw,

taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as

much damage on a successful one.

Wedging an iron spike or other object under the

pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A

successful dispel magic (DC 13) cast on the statue

destroys the trap.

PITS

Mechanical trap

Four basic pit traps are presented here.

Simple Pit. A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the

ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on

the pit's edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris.

The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the

cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit,

taking damage based on the pit's depth (usually 10 feet,

but some pits are deeper).

Hidden Pit. This pit has a cover constructed from

material identical to the floor around it.

A successful DC  15 Wisdom (Perception) check

discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section

of floor that forms the pit's cover. A successful DC

15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to

confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the

cover of a pit.

When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open

This trap uses\

.

The trip wire,is'J~nches off the ground and stretches

between two column~r trees. The net is hidden by

cobwebs or foliage. The IJC to spot the trip wire and net

is 10. A successful DC 15 D~~rity check using thieves'

tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character

without thieves' tools can attem~ this check with

disadvantage using any edged wea!'lon or edged tool.  On

a failed check, the trap triggers.

When the trap is triggered, the net is released ,

covering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are

trapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail

a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone.

A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength

check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach

on a success. The net has AC  10 and 20 hit points.

Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC  10) destroys a

5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped

in that section.

CHAPTE R  5  \  ADVENTURE  ENVIRONMENTS

like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the

pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can

be deeper.

Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar

object can be wedged between the pit's cover and the

surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover

from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover

can also be magically held shut using the arcane lock

spell or similar magic.

Locking Pit. This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit

trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers

the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit,

the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.

A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to

pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open

(determine the cover's statistics using the guidelines

in chapter 8). A character in the pit can also attempt to

disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC

15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, provided that the

mechanism can be reached and the character can see.

In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a

secret door nearby) opens the pit.

Spiked Pit. This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or

locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes

at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11

(2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to

any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison

smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking

piercing damage from the spikes must also make a

DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10)

poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage

on a successful one.

POISON  DARTS

Mechanical trap

When a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate,

poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or

pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding

walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates,

each  one rigged to  its own set of darts.

The tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and

cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or

frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC tq spot them is

15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)

check, a character can deduce the presence of the

pressure plate from variations in the mortar and

stone used to create it, compared to  the surrounding

floo r.  Wedging an iron spike or other object under the

pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing

the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained

within from launching.

The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of

weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four

darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8 bonus

against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure

plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are

no targets in the area, the darts don't hit anything.) A

ta rget that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must

ucceed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking

11  (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as

much damage on a successful one.

PO ISON  NEEDLE

J1echanical trap

A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest's

lock,  or in something else that a creature might open.

Opening the chest without the proper key causes the

needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.

When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3

mches straight out from the lock. A creature within

range takes 1 piercing damage and 11  (2d10) poison

am age, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution

aving throw or be poisoned for  1 hour.

A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check

allows a character to deduce the trap's presence from

alerations made to the lock to accommodate the needle.

_ _,_  uccessful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves'

tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from

the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock

triggers the trap.

ROLLING  SPHERE

Mechanical trap

When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this

trap's pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling

opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of

solid stone.

With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check,

a cb.aracter can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate . .

A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC

15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations

in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate's

presence. The same check made while inspecting the

ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the

trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under

the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.

Activation of the sphere requires all creatures present

to  roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8

bonus. On its turn, it  moves 60 feet in a straight line.

The sphere can move through creatures' spaces, and

creatures can move through its space, treating it as

difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature's

space or a creature enters its space while it's rolling,

that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving

throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be

knocked prone.

The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier.

It can't go around corners, but smart dungeon builders

incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages

that allow the sphere to keep moving.

As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can

attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check.

On a successful check, the sphere's speed is reduced by

15 feet. If the sphere's speed drops to 0, it stops moving

and is no longer a threat.

SPHERE  OF ANNIHILATION

Magic  trap

Magical, impenetrable darkness fills  the gaping mouth

of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in

diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it,

no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter

that enters it is instantly obliterated.

A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check

reveals that the mouth contains a sphere of annihilation

that can't be controlled or moved. It is otherwise

identical to a normal sphere of annihilation, as

described in chapter 7,  "Treasure."

Some versions of the trap include an enchantment

placed on the stone face,  such that specified creatures

feel an overwhelming urge to  approach it and crawl

inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the

sympathy aspect of the antipathy/ sympathy spell.

A successful dispel magic (DC 18) removes this

enchantment.

CHAPTER 6:  BETWEEN ADVENTURES

CAMPAIGN IS MUCH MORE THAN A SERIES OF

adventures. It also includes the moments

between them-the various distractions and

side pursuits that engage the characters

when they're not exploring the wilderness,

plundering dungeons, and gallivanting

around the multiverse on some epic quest.

The natural pace of a campaign offers lulls between

adventures, time for the characters to spend their

treasure and pursue their goals. This downtime gives

the characters an opportunity to sink their roots a little

deeper into the world, building a personal investment

in what happens to the people and places around them,

which can, in turn, draw them into further adventures.

Chapter 5, "Equipment," of the Player's Handbook

details the expenses that a character incurs for

basic necessities, depending on the lifestyle the

character chooses, from poverty to luxury. Chapter

8, "Adventuring," of that book describes some of

the downtime activities they can pursue between

adventures. This chapter fills in the gaps, describing

the expenses of owning property and hiring NPCs, and

a variety of additional downtime activities characters

can pursue. The beginning of the chapter also offers

suggestions for linking adventures together and keeping

track of events in your campaign.

LINKING ADVENTURES

A campaign in the style of an episodic television show

rarely needs story links between its adventures. Each

adventure features its own villains, and once the

characters complete the adventure, there are typically

no loose plot threads. The next adventure presents

an altogether different challenge having nothing to do

with the adventure that preceded it. As the characters

gain experience points, they become more powerful,

as do the threats they must overcome. This kind of

campaign is easy to run, since it requires little effort

beyond finding or creating adventures appropriate for

the party's level.

A campaign with a narrative lets the players feel as

though their actions have far-reaching consequences.

They're not just racking up experience points. A few

simple modifications can help you overlay overarching

elements to create a serialized campaign in which early

adventures help set up later ones.

USING AN  0VERARCHING  STORY

This section presents a couple of examples of

overarching stories which have, over the years, fueled

many classic D&D campaigns.

The adventurers' goal in the first example is to amass

the power they need to defeat a powerful enemy that

threatens the world. Their goal in the second example

is to defend something they care about by destroying

whatever threatens it. The two examples are, in effect,

the same story (variations of the battle between good

and evil) told in different ways.

EXAMPLE 1:  THE  QUEST OF  MANY PARTS

You  can tie adventures together using an overarching

goal that can be fulfilled  only by first completing a series

of related quests. For example, you could create a villain

who can't be defeated until the characters explore nine

dungeons in which the Nine Dread Princes reside, with

each of these dungeons stocked with enough monsters

and hazards to advance the adventurers two or three

levels. The adventurers spend their whole careers

fighting the Nine Dread Princes before finally pursuing

an epic quest to  destroy the princes' monstrous

progenitor. As long as every dungeon is unique and

interesting, your players will appreciate the tight focus

of the campaign.

In a similar type of quest campaign, the adventurers

might need to collect fragments of an artifact that

are scattered in ruins across the multi verse, before

reassembling the artifact and using it to defeat a

cosmic threat.

ExAMPLE  2: AGENTS  OF X

You  can also build a campaign around the idea that

the adventurers are agents of something larger than

themselves-a kingdom or secret organization, for

example. Wherever their allegiance lies, the adventurers

are motivated by loyalty and the goal of protecting

whatever it is they serve.

The characters' overarching mission might be to

explore and map an uncharted region, forging alliances

where they can and overcoming threats they encounter

along the way. Their goal might be to find the ancient

capital of a fallen empire, which lies beyond the realm

of a known enemy and forces them to navigate hostile

territory. The characters could be pilgrims in search

of a holy site or members of a secret order dedicated

to defending the last bastions of civilization in an ever

declining world. Or they might be spies and assassins,

striving to weaken an enemy country by targeting its evil

leaders and plundering its treasures.

PLANTING ADVENTURE  SEEDS

You can make a campaign feel like one story with many

chapters by planting the seeds of the next adventure

before the current one is finished. This technique can

naturally moves the characters along to their next goal.

If you've planted a seed well, the characters have

something else to do when they finish an adventure.

Perhaps a character drinks from a magic fountain in a

dungeon and receives a mystifying vision that leads to

the next quest. The party might find  a cryptic map or

relic that, once its meaning or purpose is determined,

points to a new destination. Perhaps an NPC warns

the characters of impending danger or implores

them for help.

The trick is to not distract the characters from the

adventure at hand. Designing an effective hook for a

future adventure requires finesse. The lure should be

compelling, but not so irresistible that the players stop

caring about what their characters are doing right now.

CHAPTER  6  I BETWEEN  ADVENTURES

125

To keep players from straying, save your best ideas for

the very end of your adventures, or insert them during

periods of downtime.

Here are a few examples of ways in which an

adventure seed can be revea led:

On a villain's corpse, the characters find  evidence that

the villain was working for someone else.

A captured NPC reveals the location of someone or

something that might interest the characters.

The characters are heading to a local tavern when

they spot a wanted poster or a missing person poster

(complete with the promise of a sizable reward).

Members of the local militia or city watch put out the

word that a crime has been committed , and they're

looking for  potential witnesses and suspects.

The characters receive an anonymous letter that

sheds light on a plot or impending event of which they

were previously unaware.

FORESHADOWING -------------------

Foreshadowing is an exercise in subtlety, involving the

delicate planting of seeds for future adventu res. Not all

foreshadowing bears fruit, particularly if the clues are

too subtle or if events conspire to  take your campaign

in a new direction. The goal of foreshadowing is to hint

at upcoming events and new threats in your campaign

without making it obvious to players that you're telling

them what the future holds. Here are a few examples:

An object worn or carried by an enemy has the symbol

of a previously unknown organization engraved or

written on it.

A mad woman standing on a street corner spouts

fragments of an ancient prophecy, while pointing a

crooked finger at the characters.

The king and queen announce the marriage of their

son to the daughter of a neighboring monarch , but

various factions oppose the union. Trouble is brewing.

Bugbear scouts are making incursions into civilized

lands and spying on settlements, as a prelude to a

hobgoblin warlord's invasion.



A puppet show in a market square predicts a tragic

outcome if two noble houses on the cusp of declaring

war on  each other refuse to reconcile.

NPC adventurers in a city are being murdered in a

similar yet unusual manner, hinting at a future threat

to the player characters.

CAMPAIGN TRACKING

Consistent details bring your campaign to life, and

continuity helps players imagine that their characters

are living in a real world. If the adventurers frequent

a particular tavern, the staff, layout of the building,

and decor shouldn't change much from one visit to the

next. That said, changes can occur as a result of the

characters' actions or of actions they learn about. When

the adventurers kill a monster, it stays dead, unless

someone raises it. When they remove treasure from

a room, it doesn't reappear the next time they enter

assuming it hasn't been stolen from them! If they leave a

door open, it should Stay open until someone closes it.

CHAPTER  6  I BETWEEN  ADVENTURES

No one's memory is infallible, so it pays to  keep

records. Jot notes directly on an adventure map to

keep track of open doors, disarmed traps, and the like.

Events beyond the scope of a single adventure are be

recorded in a notebook dedicated to your campaign.

Whether it's a physical book or a n electronic file , such_

record is a great way to keep your notes organized.

Your notebook might include a ny of the

following elements.

Campaign Planner. Write down the main story arc

your campaign, and keep track of things that you hope

appear in future adventures. Update it as the campaigr:.

develops, adding ideas as they come to you.

Character Notes. Write down the characters'

backgrounds and goals, since these notes can help you

design adventure content that provides opportunities ~

character development.

Keep a running tally of the adventurers' classes and

levels, as well as any quests and downtime activities

they're engaged in.

If the characters have a ship or stronghold, record iL

name and whereabouts, as well as any hirelings in  the

characters' employ.

Player Handouts. Keep a copy of all handouts

you make for your players so that you  don't have to

remember their contents later.

Adventure Log. Think of this log as an episode guide

for your campaign. Summarize each game session

or adventure to help you  keep track of the unfolding

campaign story. You can give your players access to thE

log as well, or to an edited version stripped of your nor  

and secrets. (The players might also keep their own

record of adventures, which you can refer to if your ow

log is incomplete.)

NPC Nqtes. Record statistics and roleplaying notes

for any NPC the characters interact with more than

once. For example, your notes might differentiate

important people in a town by their different voices,

as well as their names, the places where they live

and work, the names of their family members and

associates, and maybe even a secret that each one

of them has.

Campaign Calendar. Your world feels more real to

your players when the characters notice the passage of

time. Note details such as the change of seasons and

major holidays, and keep track of any important event

that affect the larger story.

Toolbox. Keep notes whenever you create or

significantly alter a monster, magic item, or trap. Keep

any maps, random dungeons, or encounters you create.

This information ensures you won't repeat your work.

and you'll be able to  draw on this material later.

RECURRING  EXPENSES

Besides the expenses associated with maintaining a

particular lifestyle, adventurers might have additional

drains on their adventuring income. Player characters

who come into possession of property, own businesses.

and employ hirelings must cover the expenses that

accompany these ventures.

emples rely on less-experienced defenders (use the

;;uard statistics in the Monster Manual).  These armed

ar riors make up the bulk of a property's skilled

'lirelings.

DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES

The campaign benefits when characters have time

between adventures to engage in other activities.

Allowing days, weeks, or months to  pass between

adventures stretches the campaign over a longer period

of time and helps to manage the characters' level

progression, preventing them from gaining too much

power too quickly.

Allowing characters to pursue side interests between

adventures also encourages players to become more

invested in the campaign world. When a character owns

a tavern in a village or spends time carousing with the

locals, that character's player is more likely to respond

to threats to the village and its inhabitants.

As your campaign progresses, your players'

characters will not only become more powerful but also

more influential and invested in the world. They might

be inclined to undertake projects that require more time

between adventures, such as building and maintaining a

stronghold. As the party gains levels, you can add more

downtime between adventures to give characters the

time they need to  pursue such interests. Whereas days

or weeks might pass between low-level adventures, the

amount of downtime between higher-level adventures

might be measured in months or years.

CRAFTING A  MAGIC  ITEM

Magic items are the DM's purview, so you decide how

they fall into the party's possession. As an option, you

can allow player characters to craft magic items.

The creation of a magic item is a lengthy, expensive

task. To start, a character must have a formula that

describes the construction of the item.  The character

must also be a spellcaster with spell slots and must

be able to cast any spells that the item can produce.

Moreover, the character must meet a level minimum

determined by the item's rarity,  as shown in the Crafting

Magic Items table. For example, a 3rd-level character

could create a wand of magic missiles (an uncommon

item), as long as the character has spell slots and can

MoRE  Do-\\~TIME AcTn~TIE

Chapter 8, Adventuring: of the Player  Handbook

describes a few downtime activities to fill the Yoid

between adventures. Depending on the style of your

campa ign and the particular backgrounds and interests

of the adventurers, you can make some or all of the

following additional activities available as options.

B U I L DI NG A  STRO NGH O L D

A character can spend time between adventures

building a stronghold. Before work can begin, the

character must acquire a plot of land. If the estate lies

within a kingdom or similar domain, the character

will need a royal charter (a legal document granting

permission to oversee the estate in the name of the

crown), a land grant (a legal document bequeathing

custody of the land to the character for as long as he

or she remains loyal to the crown), or a deed (a  legal

document that serves as proof of ownership). Land can

also be acquired by inheritance or other means.

Royal charters and land grants are usually given by

the crown as a reward for faithful service, although they

can also be bought. Deeds can be bought or inherited. A

small estate might sell for as little as 100 gp or as much

as 1,000 gp. A large estate might cost 5,000 gp or more,

if it can be bought at all.

Once the estate is secured, a character needs access

to building materials and laborers. The Building

a Stronghold table shows the cost of building the

stronghold (including materials and labor) and the

amount of time it takes, provided that the character

is using downtime to oversee construction. Work can

continue while the character is away, but each day the

character is away adds 3 days to the construction time.

CARO USING

Characters can spend their downtime engaged in a

variety of hedonistic activities such as attending parties,

binge drinking, gambling, or anything else that helps

them cope with the perils they face on their adventures.

A carousing character spends money as though

maintaining a wealthy lifestyle (see chapter 5,

"Equipment,"  of the Player's Handbook). At the end of

the period spent carousing, the player rolls percentile

dice and adds the character's level, then compares the

total to the Carousing table to determine what happens

to the character, or you choose.

might require that the weapon be forged with lava.

An item has a creation cost specified in the Crafting

of a magic item makes progress in 25 gp increments,

pending that amount for each day of work until the

oral cost is paid. The character is ass limed to work for 8

._,ours each of those days. Thus, creating an uncommon

;:nagic item takes 20 days and 500 gp. You  are free to

If a spell will be produced by the item being created,

  e creator must expend one spell slot of the spell's

':hile crafting a magic item, a character can maintain

odest lifestyle without having to pay the  1 gp per day,

a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see

prer 5, "Equipment," of the Player's Handbook).

PERFORMING  SACRED  RITES

A pious character can spend time between adventures

performing sacred rites in a temple affiliated with a god

he or she reveres . Between rites, the character spends

time in meditation and prayer.

A character who is a priest in the temple can lead

these rites, which might include weddings, funerals , and

ordinations. A layperson can offer sacrifices in a temple

or assist a priest with a rite.

A character who spends at least 10 days performing

sacred rites gains inspiration (described in chapter 4 of

the Player's Handbook) at the start of each day for the

next 2d6 days.

RUNNING A  BUSINESS

Adventurers can end up owning businesses that have

nothing to  do with delving into dungeons or saving the

world. A character might inherit a smithy, or the party

might be given a parcel of farmland or a tavern as a

reward. If they hold on to  the business, they might feel

obliged to spend time between adventures maintaining

the venture and making sure it runs smoothly.

A character rolls percentile dice and adds the number

of days spent on this downtime activity (maximum 30),

then compares the total to  the Running a Business table

to determine what happens.

If the character is required to  pay a cost as a result

of rolling on this table but fails to  do so, the business

begins to fail.  For each unpaid debt incurred in this

manner, the character takes a - 10 penalty to subsequent

rolls made on this table.

iries for a combined number of days equal to his

SELLING MAGIC  ITEMS

Few people can afford to buy a magic item, and fewer

still know how to find  one. Adventurers are exceptional

in this regard due to the nature of their profession.

A character who comes into possession of a common,

uncommon, rare,  or very rare magic item that he or

she wants to sell can spend downtime searching for a

buyer. This downtime activity can be performed only in

a city or another location where one can find wealthy

CHAPTER  6  I BETWEEN  ADVENTURES

T29

individuals interested in buying magic items. Legendary

magic items and priceless artifacts can't be sold during

downtime. Finding someone to buy such an item can be

the substance of an adventure or quest.

For each salable item, the character makes a DC 20

Intelligence (Investigation) check to find buyers. Another

character can use his or her downtime to assist with the

search, granting advantage on the checks. On a failed

check, no buyer for the item is found after a search that

lasts 10 days. On a successful check, a buyer for  the

item is found after a number of days based on the item's

rarity, as shown in the Salable Magic Item table.

A character can attempt to find  buyers for multiple

magic items at once. Although this requires multiple

Intelligence (Investigation) checks, the searches a~e

occurring simultaneously, and the results of multiple

failures or successes aren't added together. For

example, if the character finds a buyer for a common

magic item in 2 days and a buyer for an uncommon item

in 5 days, but fails to find a buyer for a rare item up for

grabs, the entire search takes 10 days.

For each item a character wishes to sell, the player

rolls percentile dice and consults the Selling a Magic

Item table, applying a modifier based on the item's

rarity, as shown in the Salable Magic Items table. The

character also makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check

and adds that check's total to the roll. The subsequent

total determines what a buyer offers to pay for the item.

You determine a buyer's identity. Buyers sometimes

procure rare and very rare items through proxies to

ensure that their identities remain unknown. If the

buyer is shady, it's up to you whether the sale creates

legal complications for the party later.

S OWING R UMORS

waying public opinion can be an effective way to bring

down a villain or elevate a friend.  Spreading rumors

is an efficient, if u nderhanded, way to accomplish that

goal. Well-placed rumors can increase the subject's

ra nding in a community or embroil someone in

scandal. A rumor needs to  be simple, concrete, and hard

o disprove. An effective r umor also has to be believable,

playing off what people want to believe about the person

in question.

Sowing a rumor about an individual or organization

equires a number of days depending on the size of the

community, as shown in the Sowing Rumors table. In a

own or city, the time spent must be continuous. If the

character spreads a rumor for ten days, disappears on

an adventure for another few days and then returns,

rhe rumor fades away without the benefit of constant

:-epetition.

The character must spend 1 gp per day to cover

_ r the end of the time spent sowing the rumor, the

haracter must make a DC 15 Charisma (Deception

r Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the

community's prevailing attitude toward the subject shifts

ne step toward friend ly or hostile, as the character

ishes . If the check fails,  the rumor gains no traction,

and further attempts to  propagate it fail.

Shifting a community's general attitude toward

a person or organization doesn't affect everyone in

e community. Individuals might hold to thei r own

pinions, particularly if they have personal experience

'"'  dealing with the subject of the rumors.

RAINING TO  GAIN LEVELS

a va riant rule, you can require characters to spend

:.owntime training or studying before they gain the

aracter has earned enough experience points to attain

CREATING D OWNTIME AC T IVITIES

Your players might be interested in pursuing downtime

activities that aren't covered in this chapter or in

the Player's Handbook. If you invent new downtime

activities, remember the following:

An activity should never negate the need or desire for

characters to go on adventures.

Activities that have a monetary cost associated with

them provide opportunities for player characters to

spend their hard-won treasure.

Activities that reveal new adventure hooks  and

previously unknown facts about your campaign can

help you foreshadow future events and conflicts.

For an activity you expect a character to  repeat

with variable degrees of success, consider creating

a random outcome table, modeled on the ones in

this chapter.

If a character belongs to a class or has a proficiency or

background that would make him or her well suited

to a particular activity, consider granting a bonus to

ability checks made by the character to complete that

activity successfully.

CHAPTER  6  I BETWEEN  ADVENTURES

CHAPTER 7:  TREASURE

DVENTURERS STRIV E FOR MAN Y THINGS,

including glory, knowledge, a nd justice.

Many adventurers also seek something more

tangible: fortune. Strands of golden chains,

stacks of platinum coins, bejeweled crowns,

enameled scepters, bolts of silk cloth, and

powerful  magic items all wait to  be seized or unearthed

by intrepid, treasure-seeking adventurers.

This chapter details magic items and the placement of

treasure in an adventure, as well as special rewards that

can be granted instead of or in addition to magic items

a nd  mundane treasure.

TYPES  OF TREASURE

Treasure comes in  many forms .

Coins. The most basic type of treasure is money,

including copper pieces (cp), silver pieces (sp),  electrum

pieces (ep),  gold pieces (gp), and platinum pieces (pp).

Fifty coins of any type weigh 1 pound.

Gemstones. Gemstones are small, lightweight, and

easily secured compared to their same value in coins.

ee the "Gemstones" section for types of stones, gems,

and jewels that can be found as treasure.

Art Objects. Idols cast of solid gold, necklaces

tudded with precious stones, paintings of ancient

kings, bejeweled dishes- art objects include all these

a nd more. See the "Art Obj ects" sectiori for  types of

decorative and valuable artworks that can be found

as treasure.

Magic Items. Types of magic items include armor,

potions , scrolls, rings , rods, staffs, wands, weapons,

a nd wondrous items. Magic items also have rarities:

common , uncommon, rare, very ra re, and legendary.

Intelligent monsters often use magic items in their

possession , while others might hide them away to

ensure they don't get lost or stolen. For example, if a

hobgoblin tribe has a +llongsword and an alchemy jug

in its treasure hoard, the tribe's warlord might wield the

word , while the jug is kept somewhere safe.

RANDOM TREASURE

The following pages contain tables that you can use

to randomly generate treasures carried by monsters,

tashed in their lairs, or otherwise hidden away. The

placement of treasure is left to your discretion. The key

is to make sure the players feel rewarded for playing,

and that their characters are rewarded for overcoming

dangerous challenges.

TREASURE TABLES

Treasure can be randomly allocated based on a

monster's challenge rating. There are tables for

challenge rating 0- 4, challenge rating 5- 10, challenge

rating 11- 16, and challenge rating 17  and higher. Use

these tables to  randomly determine how much money

a n individual monster carries (the D&D equivalent of

pocket change) or the amount of wealth found in a larger

treasure hoard.

'

US ING THE  INDIVIDUA L TREASURE TABLES

An  Individual Treasure table helps you  randomly

determine how much treasure one creature carries on

its person. If a monster has no interest in amassing

treasure, you can use this table to determine the

incidental treasure left behind by the monster's victims.

Use the Individual Treasure table that corresponds to

the monster's challenge rating. Roll  a dlOO, and read the

result across to determine how many coins of each type

the monster carries. The table also includes the average

result in parentheses, should you wish to forgo another

roll and save time. To determine the total amount of

individual treasure for a group of similar creatures, you

can save time by rolling once and multiplying the result

by the number of creatures in the group.

If it doesn't make sense for a monster to carry a large

pile of coins, you  can convert the coins into gemstones

or art objects of equal value.

USING THE TREASURE  HOARD TABLES

A Treasure Hoard table helps you randomly determine

the contents of a large cache of treasure, the

accumulated wealth of a large group of creatures (such

as an ore tribe or a hobgoblin ar my), the belongings of

a single powerful creature that likes to hoard treasure

(such as a dragon), or the reward bestowed upon a party

after completing a quest for a benefactor. You can also

split up a treasure hoard so that the adventurers don't

find  or receive it all at once.

When determining the contents of a hoard belonging

to one monster, use the table that corresponds to that

monster's challenge rating. When rolling to dete rmine a

treasure hoard belonging to a large group of monsters,

use the challenge rating of the monster that leads the

group. If the hoard belongs to no one, use the challenge

rating of the monster that presides over the dungeon

or lair you are stocking. If the hoard is a gift from a

benefactor, use the challenge rating equal to  the party's

average level.

Every treasure hoard contains a random number of

coins, as shown at the top of each table. Roll a dlOO and

consult the table to determine how many gemstones or

art objects the hoard contains, if any.  Use the same roll

to determine whether the hoard contains magic items.

As with the individual treasure tables, average values

are given in parentheses. You  can use an average value

instead of rolling dice to save time.

If a treasure hoard seems too small, you can roll

multiple times on the table. Use this approach for

monsters that are particularly fond of amassing

treasure.  Legendary creatures that accumulate treasure

are wealthier than normal. Always roll at least twice on

the appropriate table and add the results together.

You can ha nd out as much or as little treasure as you

want. Over the course of a typical campaign, a party

finds treasure hoards amounting to seven rolls on the

Challenge 0- 4 table, eighteen rolls on the Challenge

5- 10 table, twelve rolls on the Challenge 11- 16 table,

a nd eight rolls on the Challenge 17+ table.

GEMSTONES

If a treasure hoard includes gemstones , you can use

the following tables to  randomly determine the kind

of gemstones found , based on their value. You can roll

once and assume all the gems are the same, or roll

multiple times to create mixed collections of gemstones.

MAGIC  ITEMS

Magic items are gleaned from  the hoards of conquered

monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such

items grant capabilities a character could rarely

have otherwise,  or they complement their owner's

capabilities in wondrous ways.

RARITY

Each magic item has a rarity: common, uncommon,

rare, very rare, or legendary. Common magic items,

such as a potion of healing, are the most plentiful. Some

legendary items, such as the apparatus of Kwalish, are

unique. The game assumes that the secrets of creating

the most powerful items arose centuries ago and were

then gradually lost as a result of wars, cataclysms, and

mishaps. Even uncommon items can't be easily created.

Thus, many magic items are well-preserved antiquities.

Rarity provides a rough measure of an item's power

relative to other magic items. Each rarity corresponds

to character level, as shown in the Magic Item Rarity  .

table. A character doesn't typically find  a rare magic

item, for example, until around 5th level.  That said,

rarity shou ldn't get in the way of your campaign's story.

If you want a ring of invisibility to fall into the hands of

a  1st-level character, so be it.  No doubt a great story will

arise from  that event.

If your campaign allows for  trade in magic items,

rarity can also help you set prices for them. As the DM,

you determine the value of an individual magic item

based on its rarity. Suggested values are provided in

the Magic Item Rarity table. The value of a consumable

item, such as a potion or scroll, is typically half the value

of a permanent item of the same rarity.

Unless you decide your campaign works otherwise,

most magic items are so rare that they aren't available

for  purchase. Common items, such as a potion of

healing,  can be procured from an alchemis t, herbalist,

or spellcaster. Doing so is ra rely as simple as walking

into a shop and selecting an item from a shelf. The seller

might ask for a service, rather than coin.

In a large city with an academy of magic or a major

temple, buying and selling magic items might be

possible, at your discretion. If your world includes a

large number of adventurers engaged in retrieving

ancient magic items, trade in these items might be more

common. Even so, it's likely to remain similar to  the

market for fine art in the real world, with invitation-only

auctions and a tendency to attract thieves.

Selling magic items is difficult in most D&D worlds

primarily because of the challenge of finding a buyer.

CHAPTER  7  I TREASURE

135

Plenty of people might like to have a magic sword, but

few of them can afford it.  Those who can afford such an

item usually have more practical things to spend on. See

chapter 6, "Between Adventures," for one way to handle

selling magic items.

In your campaign, magic items might be prevalent

enough that adventurers can buy and sell them with

some effort. Magic items might be for sale in bazaars or

auction houses in fantastical locations, such as the City

of Brass, the planar metropolis of Sigil, or even in more

ordinary cities. Sale of magic items might be highly

regulated, accompanied by a thriving black market.

Artificers might craft items for use by military forces

or adventurers, as they do in the world of Eberron. You

might also allow characters to craft their own magic

items, as discussed in chapters 6.

IDENTIFYING A  MAGIC  ITEM

Some magic items are indistinguishable from their

nonmagical counterparts, whereas other magic items

display their magical nature conspicuously. Whatever a

magic item's appearance, handling the item is enough to

give a character a sense that something is extraordinary

about it.  Discovering a magic item's properties isn't

automatic, however.

The identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an

item's properties. Alternatively, a character can focus

on one magic item during a short rest, while being in

INDIVIDUAL  TREASURE:  CHALLENGE  0-4

physica l contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the

character learns the item's properties, as well as how

to use them. Potions are an exception; a little taste is

enough to tell the taster what the potion does.

Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its

properties. The command word to  activate a ring mighr

be etched in tiny letters inside it, or a feathered design

might suggest that it's a ring of feather falling.

Wearing or experimenting with an item can also offer

hints about its properties. For example, if a character

puts on a ring of jumping, you could say, "Your steps fee

strangely springy." Perhaps the character then jumps

up and down to see what happens. You  then say the

character jumps unexpectedly high.

VARIANT:  MORE  DIFFICULT IDENTIFICATIO N

If you prefer magic items to have a greater mystique,

consider removing the ability to identify the properties

of a magic item during a short rest, and require the

identify spell, experimentation, or both to reveal what a

magic item does.

ATTUNEMENT

Some magic items require a creature to form a bond

with them before their magical properties can be used .

This bond is called attunement, and certain items

have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class,

a  creature must be a member of that class to attune to

the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class , a monster

qualifies if that monster has spell slots and uses that

class's spell list.)

Without becoming attuned to an item that requires

attunement, a creature gains only its non magical

benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For

example, a magic shield that requires attunement

provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not

attuned to it,  but none of its magical properties.

Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend

a short rest focused on only that item while being in

physical coritact with it (this can't be the same short rest

used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take

the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation

(for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate

activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement

attempt fails.  Otherwise, at the end of the short rest,

the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to

activate any magical properties of the item, including

any necessary command words.

i  cursed. Most methods of identifying items, including

rhe identify spell, fail  to reveal such a curse, although

ore might hint at it. A curse should be a surprise to  the

item's user when the curse's effects are revealed.

Attunement to a cursed item can't be ended voluntarily

unless the curse is broken first, such as with the remove

curse spell.

.YfAGIC  ITEM  CATEGORIES

Each magic item belongs to a category: armor,

potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs, wands, weapons, or

"'"ondrous items.

_-\RM OR

nless an armor's description says otherwise, armor

must be worn for its magic to function.

Some suits of magic armor specify the type of armor

;hey are, such as chain mail or plate. If a magic armor

doesn't specify its armor type, you may choose the type

or determine it randomly.

P OTIONS

Different kinds of magical liquids are grouped in the

category of potions: brews made from enchanted herbs,

water from magical fountains or sacred springs, and

oils that are applied to a creature or object. Most potions

consist of one ounce of liquid.

Potions are consumable magic items. Drinking a

potion or administering a potion to another character

TREASURE  HOARD:  CHALLENGE  17+

requires an action. Applying an oil might take longer, as

specified in its description. Once used, a potion takes

effect immediately, and it is used up.

RINGS

Magic rings offer an amazing array of powers to  those

lucky enough to find  them. Unless a ring's description

says otherwise, a ring must be worn on a finger, or a

similar digit, for  the ring's magic to function.

RODS

A scepter or just a heavy cylinder, a magic rod is

typically made of metal, wood, or bone. It's about 2 or 3

feet long, 1 inch thick, and 2 to  5 pounds.

SCROLLS

Most scrolls are spells stored in written form, while

a few bear unique incantations that produce potent

wards. Whatever its contents, a scroll is a roll of paper,

sometimes attached to wooden rods, and typically kept

safe in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood.

A scroll is a consumable magic item. Whatever the

nature of the magic contained in a scroll, unleashing

that magic requires using an action to read the scroll.

When its magic has been invoked, the scroll can't be

used again. Its words fade, or it crumbles into dust.

Any creature that can understand a written language

can read the arcane script on a scroll and attempt to

activate it.

STAFFS

A magic staff is about 5 or 6 feet long. Staffs vary widely

in appearance: some are of nearly equal diameter

throughout and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted,

some are made of wood, and others are composed of

polished metal or crystal. Depending on the material , a

staff weighs between 2 and 7 pounds.

Unless a staff's description says otherwise, a staff can

be used as a quarterstaff.

WANDS

A magic wand is about 15 inches long and crafted of

metal, bone, or wood. It is tipped with metal, crystal ,

stone, or some other material.

WEAPONS

Whether crafted for some fell  purpose or forged to

serve the highest ideals of chivalry, magic weapons are

coveted by many adventurers.

Some magic weapons specify the type of weapon

they are in their descriptions, such as a longsword or

VARIANT:  MIXING  POTIONS

A character might drink one potion while still  under the

effects of another, or pour several  potions  into a single

container. The strange ingredients  used  in  creating potions

can  result  in  unpredictable interactions.

When  a character mixes two  potions together, you  can

roll  on  the  Potion  Miscibility table.  If more than two  are

combined,  roll  again  for  each  subsequent potion , combining

the  results.  Unless the effects  are  immediately obvious,

reveal  them only when  they  become evident.

The mixture creates a magical  explosion,

dealing 6d10 force  damage to the  mixer  and

1d10 force damage to each creature within  5

feet of the mixer.

The  mixture  becomes an  ingested  poison of

the  OM 's choice.

Both  potions  lose their effects.

One  potion  loses  its  effect.

Both  potions work,  but with their numerical

effects and  durations halved.  A potion  has  no

effect if it can't be  halved  in  this way.

Both  potions work  normally.

The  numerical  effects and  duration of one

potion are doubled.  If neither potion  has

anything to double in  this way,  they work

normally.

Only one  potion works,  but its  effect is

permanent. Choose the simplest effect to

make  permanent, or the one that seems

the  most fun.  For example , a potion of

healing might increase the drinker's hit  point

maximum  by 4,  or oil of etherealness might

permanently trap the user in  the Ethereal

Plane. At your discretion,  an  appropriate

spell, such as dispel magic or remove curse ,

might end this lasting effect.

CHAPTER  7  I TREASURE

longbow. If a magic weapon doesn't specify its weapon

type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.

WONDROUS  ITEMS

Wondrous items include worn items such as boots,

belts , capes, gloves, and various pieces of jewelry and

decoration, such as amulets, brooches, and circlets.

Bags, carpets, crystal balls, figurines, horns, musical

instruments, and other objects also fall  into this catch

all category.

WEARING AND WIELDING  ITEMS

Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing

or wielding it. A magic item meant to  be worn must be

donned in the intended fashion:  boots go on the feet,

gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head , and

rings on the finger.  Magic armor must be donned, a

shield strapped to  the arm, a cloak fastened about the

shoulders. A weapon must be held in hand.

In most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn

can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many

magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or the:

magically adjust themselves to the wearer.

Rare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good

reason for an item to fit  only creatures of a certain

size or shape, you can rule that it doesn't adjust. For

example, armor made by the drow might fit  elves only.

VARIANT:  SCROLL  MISHAPS

A creature who tries  and  fails  to cast a spell  from  a spell scroll

must make  a  DC  10  Intelligence saving throw.  If the saving

throw fails,  roll  on the Scroll  Mishap table.

A surge of magical  energy deals the caster 1d6

force  damage  per level  of the spell.

The spell affects the caster or an  ally

(determined  randomly)  instead of the intended

target,  or it  affects a random target nearby if the

caster was the intended target.

The spell  affects a random  location within the

spell's  range.

The spell's effect is  contrary to  its  normal one ,

but  neither harmful  nor beneficial.  For  instance,

a fireball  might  produce an  area of harmless

cold.

The caster suffers a minor but bizarre effect

related to the spell.  Such effects last only

as  long as  the original spell's duration , or

1d10  minutes for  spells that take effect

instantaneously.  For example,  a fireball  might

cause smoke to  billow from  the caster's ears for

1d10  minutes.

The spell  activates after 1d12  hours.  If the

caster was the  intended target, the spell takes

effect normally.  If the caster was  not the

intended target, the spell  goes off in  the general

direction of the intended target,  up to the spell 's

maximum  range, ifthe target has  moved  away.

Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf-sized

and dwarf-shaped characters.

When a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your

discretion as to whether the item functions as intended.

A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a yuan-ti

with a snakelike tail instead of legs can't wear boots.

MU LT IPLE  ITEMS  OF THE  SAME  KIND

Use common sense to determine whether more than

one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A

character can't normally wear more than one pair of

footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of

bracers, one suit of armor, one item of head wear, and

one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might

be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or

be able to layer two cloaks.

PAIRED  I T EMS

Items that come in pairs- such as boots, bracers,

gauntlets, and gloves-impart their benefits only if both

items of the pair are worn. For example, a character

wearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and

a boot of elvenkind on  the other foot gains no benefit

from either item.

AC TI VAT I NG A N  I TE M

Activating some magic items requires a user to do

omething special, such as holding the item and uttering

a command word. The description of each item category

or individual item details how an item is activated.

Certain items use one or more of the following rules for

their activation.

If an item requires an action to activate, that action

isn't a function of the Use an Item action, so a feature

such as the rogue's Fast Hands can't be used to

activate  the item.

C OMMAND WOR D

A command word is a word or phrase that must be

poken for an item to work. A magic item that requires

a command word can't be activated in an area where

ound is prevented, as in the area of the silence spell.

C ONSUMABLES

S ome items are used up when they are activated. A

potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied

to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is

read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic.

MAGIC  ITEM  FORMULAS

A magic item  formula  explains  how to make a particular

magic  item . Such  a formula  can  be  an  excellent reward  if you

allow player characters to craft magic  items,  as  explained  in

ch apter 6, "Between Adventures."

You  can award  a formula  in  place of a magic  item.  Usuall y

written  in  a book or on  a scroll , a formula  is  one step rarer

tha n the item  it  allows  a character to create. For example,

th e formula for  a common  magic  item  is  uncommon . No

fo rmulas exist for  legendary item s.

If the creation of magic items  is  commonplace in  your

ca mpaign, a formula  can  have a rarity that matches the

rar ity of the item  it  allows a character to create. Formulas for

common and  uncommon  items  might even  be for  sale, each

with  a cost double that of its  ma gic  item .

SPELLS

S ome magic items allow the user to cast a spell from

the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell

level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and

requires no components, unless the item's  description

says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time,

range, and duration , and the user of the item must

concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many

items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell

and confer the spell's effects, with their usual duration.

Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing

the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.

A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require

you to use your own spellcasting ability when you

cast a spell from  the item. If you have more than one

spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with

the item. If you don't have a spellcasting ability-perhaps

you're a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature- your

spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your

proficiency bonus does apply.

CHARGES

Some magic items have charges that must be expended

to activate their properties. The number of charges an

item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell

is cast on it, as well as when a creature attunes to it.

Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature

attuned to it learns how many charges it regained.

MAGIC  I T EM  R ESILI ENCE

Most magic items are objects of extraordinary

artisanship. Thanks to a combination of careful crafting

and magical reinforcement, a magic item is at least as

durable as a nonmagical item of its kind. Most magic

items, other than potions and scrolls, have resistance

to all damage. Artifacts are practically indestructible,

requiring extraordinary measures to destroy.

SPECIAL FEATUR ES

You  can add distinctiveness to  a magic item by thinking

about its backstory. Who made the item? Is anything

unusual about its construction? Why was it made, and

how was it originally used? What minor magical quirks

set it apart from other items of its kind? Answering

these questions can help turn a generic magic item,

such as a +llongsword, into a  more flavorful discovery.

The tables that follow can help you come up with

answers. Roll on as many of these tables as you like.

Some of the table entries make more sense for certain

items than for others. Some magic items are made

only by certain kinds of creatures, for instance; a cloak

of elvenkind is made by elves, rather than dwarves. If

you roll something that doesn't make sense, roll again,

choose a more appropriate entry, or use the rolled detail

as inspiration to make up your own.

VARIANT:  WANDS  THAT  DoN'T RECHARGE

A typica l wand  has expendable charges.  If you 'd like  wands to

be  a lim ited  resource, you  can  make  some of them  incapable

ADAMANTINE ARMOR

Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide),  uncommon

This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one

of the hardest substances in existence. While you're

wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a

normal hit.

ALCHEMY jUG

liquid. Afterward, you can uncork the jug as an action

and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The

maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends

on the liquid you named.

Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce

a different one, or more of one that has reached its

maximum, until the next dawn.

perceived through magical scrying sensors.

AMULET OF THE  PLANES

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to

name a location that you are familiar with on another

plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence

check. On a successful check, you cast the plane shift

spell. On a failure , you and each creature and object

within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination.

Roll a dlOO.  On a 1- 60, you travel to a random location

ANIMATED  SHIELD

ANIMATE D  SHIELD

Armor (shield),  very rare (requires atttinement)

While holding this shield, you can speak its command

word as a bonus action to cause it to animate. The shield

leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect

you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free.

The shield remains animated for  1 minute, until you

use a bonus action to end this effect, or until you are

incapacitated or die, at which point the shield falls  to the

ground or into your hand if you have one free.

APPARATUS  OF KWALISH

Wondrous item, legendary

This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel

weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a  hidden catch,

which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence

(Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a

hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or

smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in

a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to

move either up or down. When certain levers are used,

the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.

The apparatus of Kwalish is a Large object with the

following statistics:

Armor Class: 20

Hit Points: 200

Speed: 30 ft.,  swim 30 ft.  (or 0 ft.  for  both if the legs and

tail aren't extended)

Damage Immunities: poison, psychic

To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot.

While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment

is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds

enough air for  10 hours of breathing, divided by the

number of breathing creatures inside.

The apparatus floats on water. It can also go

underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the

vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute

from pressure.

A creature in the compartment can use an action to

move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or

down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral

position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as

shown in the Apparatus of Kwalish Levers table.

ARMOR OF VULNERABILITY

Armor (plate),  rare (requires attunement)

While wearing this armor, you have resistance to one

of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing,

or slashing. The DM chooses the type or determines

it randomly.

Curse. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed

only when an identify spell is cast on the armor or you

attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you

are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic:

removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed

you have vulnerability to two of the three damage type

associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants

resistance).

ARROW-CATCHING SHIELD

Armor (shield),  rare (requires attunement)

You gain a +2  bonus to AC  against ranged attacks while

you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the

shield's normal bonus to AC.  In addition, whenever an

attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within

5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the

target of the attack instead.

ARROW OF  SLAYING

Weapon (arrow),  very rare

An arrow of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay

a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused

than others; for example, there are both arrows of

dragon slaying and arrows of blue dragon slaying. If a

creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated

with an arrow of slaying takes damage from the arrow,

the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving

throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed

save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once an arrow of slaying deals its extra damage to a

creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist,

such as bolts of slaying meant for a crossbow, though

arrows are most common.

BAG OF BEANS

Wondrous item, rare

Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The

bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean

it contains.

If you dump the bag's contents out on the ground, they

explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans.

Each creature in the area, including you, must make a

DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage

on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful

one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that

aren't being worn or carried.

If you remove a bean from  the bag, plant it in dirt or

sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect

1 minute later from the ground where it was planted.

The DM can choose an effect from the following table,

determine it randomly, or create an effect.

the same plane of existence as the statue, it  knows

where you  are. The statue becomes inanimate after

24  hours.

randomly choosing among equally low  scores. On

a failed  save, the creature takes 10d6 force damage

A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a  height

of the  DM's choice. The top leads where the  DM

chooses, such as to a great view,  a cloud  giant's

cast le , or a different plane of existence.

BAG  OF

DEVOURING

BAG O F  DEVOURING

Wondrous item, very rare

This bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a

feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature.

Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.

The extradimensional creature attached to  the bag

can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or

vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured

and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed

in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it,

there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled

inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its

action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength

check. Another creature can use its action to reach into

the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful

DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the

bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag

is devoured, its body destroyed.

Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which

can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once

each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and

spits them out into another plane of existence. The DM

determines the time and plane.

If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and

anything contained within it is transported to a random

location on the Astral Plane.

BAG  OF  HOLDING

Wondrous item, uncommon

This bag has an interior space considerably larger

than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter

at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to

500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet.

The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents.

Retrieving an item from  the bag requires an action.

If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures

and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the

CHAPTER  7  I TREASURE

153

BELT  OF

DwARVENKIND

Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents

spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right

before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside

the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal

to  10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1

minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.

Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional

space created by a Heward's handy haversack, portable

hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and

opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates

where the one item was placed inside the other. Any

creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it

to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then

closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

BAG  OF  TRICKS

Wondrous item,  uncommon

This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth,

appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however,

reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag

weighs 1/ 2 pound.

You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the

bag and throw it up to  20 feet. When the object lands,

it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling

a  d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the

bag's color. See the Monster Manual for the creature's

statistics.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions,

and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to

command how the creature moves and what action it

takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such

as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders,

the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.

Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the

bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.

You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60

feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed.

Each creature within a  10-foot radius of where the bead

landed must succeed on a DC  15 Dexterity saving throw

or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent

force then encloses the area for  1 minute. Any creature

that failed the save and is completely within the area is

trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded

on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed

you are unwilling to part with the axe, keeping it within

reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack

rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe  is

within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

Whenever a hostile creature damages you while the

axe is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15

Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you

must use your action each round to  attack the creature

nearest to you with the axe. If you can make extra

attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra

attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after

you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible

targets, you attack one at random. You  are berserk until

you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of

you that you can see or hear.

a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of

1 minute from the candle's total burn time.

While lit,  the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot

radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment

matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving

throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a

cleric or druid in the light whose a lignment matches the

candle's can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared

without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is

as if cast with a  1st-level slot.

knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime

prevents it from  being tipped over.  The roof, the door,

and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to

damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege

weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a

wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell

counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each

casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to

regain 50 hit points.

DAGGER OF VENOM

Weapon (dagger),  rare

You gain a +1  bonus to attack and damage rolls made

with this magic weapon.

You can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into

the air and speak the command word. When you do so,

the sword begins to  hover, flies up to  30 feet, and attacks

one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The

word uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to

damage rolls.

While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to

cause it to fly  up to  30 feet to another spot within 30 feet

of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause

rhe sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.

After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it

ies up to  30 feet and tries to  return to your hand. If you

have no hand free , it falls to the ground at your feet. If

the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as

close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also

ceases to  hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet

away from it.

out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start

of your next turn. Choose from  the following options:

"Stream" produces 1 gallon of water.

"Fountain" produces 5 gallons of water.

"Geyser" produces 30 gallons of water that gushes

forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a

bonus action while holding the decanter, you can aim

the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of

you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength

saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall

prone. Instead of a creature, you can target an object

that isn't being worn or carried and that weighs no

more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked

over or pushed up to  15 feet away from you.

DECK OF  ILLUSIONS

Wondrous item, uncommon

This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full

deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually

missing 1d20 - 1 cards.

The magic of the deck functions only if cards are

drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing

cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to

draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the

ground at a point within 30 feet of you.

An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the

thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory

creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and

behaves as if it were a real creature (as presented in the

Monster Manual), except that it can do no harm. While

you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and

can see it, you can use an action to move it magically

anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical

interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an

illusion , because objects pass through it.  Someone who

is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its

card disappears, and that card can't be used again .

cards you  intend to  draw and then draw them randomly

Two  of the cards  in  a deck  of many things can earn a character

the enmity of another being. With  the  Flames card, the

enmity is  overt. The character should experience the devil's

malevolent efforts on  multiple occasions. Seeking out the

fiend  shouldn't be  a simple task,  and the adventurer should

clash with  the devil's  allies  and followers  a few  times before

being able to confront the devil  itself.

In  the case of the  Rogue card,  the enmity is  secret and

should come from  someone thought to  be  a friend  or an

ally.  As  Dungeon  Master, you  should wait for  a dramatically

appropriate moment to reveal  this  enmity,  leaving the

adventurer guessing who  is  likely to  become a betrayer.

happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you

your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity

lasts until either you or the devil dies.

Fool. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw

intervention can end the NPC's  hostility toward you.

Ruin. All  forms of wealth that you carry or own,

own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any

humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and

carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of

the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks yo~,

warning all others that you must win the battle alone.

The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points,

whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you,

slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.

Wondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze),

or legendary (iron)

You can use an action to blow this horn. In response,

warrior spirits from the plane ofYsgard appear within

60 feet of you. These spirits use the berserker statistics

'rom the Monster Manual.  They return to Ysgard after  1

hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the

horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

Four types of horn of Valhalla  are known to exist, each

made of a different metal. The horn's type determines

how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as

four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar

creature, they allow the creature to move normally

while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect

means the cre.ature can cross or stand above nonsolid

or unstable surfaces , such as water or lava. The

creature leaves no tracks and ignores difficult terrain. In

addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up

to  12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a

can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight

causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use

an action to  make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the

fixed rod up to  10 feet on a success.

An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of it

kind, superior to  an ordinary instrument in every way.

Seven types of these instruments exist, each named

after a legendary bard college. The following table lists

the spells common to all instruments, as well as the

spells specific to each one and its rarity. A creature that

attempts to play the instrument without being attuned

to  it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or

take 2d4 psychic damage.

You  can use an action to  play the instrument and cast

one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to

cast a spell, it can't be used to  cast that spell again until

the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability

and spell save DC.

When you use the instrument to cast a spell that

causes targets to  become charmed on a failed save, the

targets have disadvantage on the saving throw. This

effect applies whether you are using the instrument as

the source of the spell or as a spellcasting focus.

another creature must use an action to grasp or net

the stone to separate it from you, either by making a

worn while it orbits your head.

Absorption (Very Rare). While this  pale lavender

ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to

cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you

can see and targeting only you.

Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it

burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you

are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the

number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't

cancel it.

Agility(Very Rare). Your Dexterity score increases by

your head.

Awareness (Rare). You can't be surprised while this

rhomboid orbits your head.

Greater Absorption (Legendary). While this marbled

lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can

use your reaction to  cancel a spell of 8th level or lower

cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.

Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it

burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you

are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the

number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't

cancel it.

Mastery (Legendary). Your proficiency bonus

increases by  1 while this pale green prism orbits

your head.

Protection (Rare). You gain a +1 bonus to AC while

this dusty rose prism orbits your head.

Regeneration (Legendary). You  regain 15 hit points

at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits

your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.

Reserve (Rare). This vibrant purple prism stores

spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The

stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time.

When found,  it contains ld4 - 1 levels of stored spells

chosen by the DM.

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level

into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The

s pell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone.

If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended

without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell

determines how much space it uses.

While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any

s pell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level , spell save

DC , spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the

original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the

IRON  BANDS  OF  BILARRO

Wondrous item, rare

This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter

and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak

the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or

smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As

the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle

of metal bands.

Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal

to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus.

On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus

action to speak the command word again to release it.

Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands

to contract and become a sphere once more.

A creature, including the one restrained, can use an

action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the

iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed , and

the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails,  any

further attempts made by that creature automatically

fail until 24 hours have elapsed.

Once the bands are used , they can't be used again

until the next dawn.

LANTERN  OF

R e vEALING

IRON  FLASK

Wondrous item, legendary

This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an

action to speak the flask's command word, targeting a

creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the

target is native to  a plane of existence other than the one

you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom

saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has

been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the

saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the

flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature

at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't need to

breathe, eat, or drink and doesn't age.

You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper

and release the creature the flask contains. The creature

is friendly to you and your companions for  1 hour and

obeys your commands for  that duration. If you give no

commands or give it a command that is likely to result

in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no

actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in

accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.

An identify spell  reveals that a creature is inside

the flask, but the only way to determine the type of

creature is to  open the flask. A newly discovered bottle

might already contain a creature chosen by the DM or

determined randomly.

While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an

action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or

call out a particular cell by number. The creature named

or contained in the named cell appears as an image

Weapon (any sword),  very rare (requires attunement)

The sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical

hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points,

it must succeed on a DC  15 Constitution saving throw or

be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its

body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword

loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword

has no charges remaining, it loses this property.

NOLZUR'S  MARVELOUS  PIGMENTS

Wondrous item,  very rare

Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box

with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments

allow you to  create three-dimensional objects by

painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from

the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate

on its image.

Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square

feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects

or terrain features-such as a door, a pit, flowers,  trees,

cells, rooms, or weapons- that are up to  10,000 cubic

feet.  It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.

When you complete the painting, the object or terrain

feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object.

Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door

that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit

on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against

the total area of objects you create.

Nothing created by the pigments can have a value

greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value

(such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks

authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from

paste, bone, or some other worthless material.

If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning,

the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you

complete the painting, doing no harm to  anything.

0ATHBOW

Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)

When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in

Elvish, "Swift defeat to my enemies." When you use

this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a

command phrase, say, "Swift death to you who have

wronged me." The target of your attack becomes your

sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later.

You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time.

When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new

one after the next dawn.

When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon

against your sworn enemy, you  have advantage on the

roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover,

other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage

due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy

takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage.

While your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage

on attack rolls with all other weapons.

OIL OF  ETHEREALNESS

OIL OF  SHARPNESS

Potion,  very rare

This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultrathin

silver shards. The oil can coat one slashing or piercing

weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing

ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1

OIL OF  SLIPPERINESS

Potion,  uncommon

This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in  the

container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can

cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the

equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional

vial is required for each size category above Medium).

Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature

then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell

for 8 hours.

Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as

an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating

level.  Once you have used the pearl, it can't be used

P I PES  OF  liAUNTING

PiPES  OF  THE  SEWERS

PIPES  OF  HAUNTING

Wondrous item,  uncommon

You  must be proficient with wind instruments to use

these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action

to  play them and expend 1 charge to  create an eerie,

spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you

that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom

saving throw or become frightened of you for  1 minute.

If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren't hostile

toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw.

A creature that fails  the saving throw can repeat it at the

end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a

success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw

is immune to the effect of these pipes for  24 hours. The

pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

PIPES  OF THE  SEWERS

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

You  must be proficient with wind instruments to use

these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary

rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will

not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.

The pipes have 3 charges. If you  play the pipes as

an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to

3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats (see the

Monster Manual for statistics) with each expended

charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile

of you  to  be called in this fashion (as determined by

the DM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm,

the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the

music by the shortest available route but aren't under

your control otherwise. The pipes regain ld3 expended

charges daily at dawn.

Whenever a swarm of rats that isn't under another

creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you

are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check

contested by the swarm's Wisdom check. If you lose

the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would

and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next

24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed

by the pipes' music and becomes friendly to you and

your companions for as long as you continue to play the

pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys

your commands. If you issue no commands to  a friendly

swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions.

If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can't hear the

pipes' music, your control over that swarm ends, and

the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be

swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.

PLATE ARMOR OF  ETHEREALNESS

Armor (plate),  legendary (requires attunement)

While you're wearing this armor, you can speak its

command word as an action to gain the effect of the

etherealness spell, which last for  10 minutes or until

you remove the armor or use an action to speak the

command word again. This property of the armor can't

be used again until the next dawn.

PORTABLE  HOLE

Wondrous item, rare

This fine  black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the

dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular

sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can use an action to unfold a portable hole and

place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the

portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10

feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists

CHAPTER 7  I TREASURE

on a different plane, so it can't be u  ed to create open

passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can

exit the hole by climbing out of it.

You can use an action to  close a portable hole by

taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up.

Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or

objects within remain in the extradimensional space.  o

matter what's in it,  the hole weighs next to  nothing.

If the hole is folded up, a creature with in  the hole's

extradimensional space can use an action to make

a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the

creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of

the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing

creature within a closed portable hole can s urvive for up

to  10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.

Placing a portable hole inside an extradimensional

space created by a bag of holding, Heward's handy

haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items

and opens a gate to  the Astral Plane. The gate originates

where the one item was placed inside the other. Any

creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it

and deposited in a  random location on the Astral Plane.

T he gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't

be reopened.

R oD  OF ABSORPTIO N

Rod, very rare (requires attunement)

While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to

absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not with an

area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled,

and the spell's energy- not the spell itself- is stored in

the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when

it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to  50 levels

of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod

absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can't absorb more. If you

are targeted by a spell that the rod can't store, the rod

has no effect on that spell.

When you become attuned to the rod, you know how

ma ny levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the

course of its existence, and how many levels of spell

energy it currently has stored.

If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can

convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells

you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots

only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell

slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You  use the stored

levels  in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell

as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in

the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.

A newly found rod has  ldlO levels of spell energy

stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb

spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes

nonmagical.

the paradise takes. It could be a tranquil garden, lovely

glade, cheery tavern, immense palace, tropical island,

fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine.

Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough

water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else

that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space

can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from

a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside

the extraplanar space.

CHAPTER  7  I TREASURE

SENTIENT MAGIC  ITEMS

Some magic items possess sentience and personality.

Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirr

of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic

used to create it.  In any case, the item behaves like a

character, complete with personality quirks, ideals ,

bonds, and sometimes flaws . A sentient item might

be a cherished ally to  its wielder or a continual thorn

in the side.

Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of ite  -

can manifest sentience, but consumable items such a_

potions and scrolls are never sentient.

Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the

DM's control. Any activated property of the item is

under the item's control, not its wielder's. As long as

the wielder maintains a good relationship with the

item , the wielder can access those properties normall_

If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress

its activated properties or even turn them against

the wielder.

CREATING  SENTIENT MAGIC  ITEMS

When you decide to make a magic item sentient, you

create the item's persona in the same way you would

create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here.

ABILITIES

A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and

Charisma scores. You  can choose the item's abilities

or determine them randomly. To determine them

randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest r

and totaling the rest.

COMMUNICATION

A sentient item has some ability to communicate, either

by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts

telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how 

communicates or roll on the following table.

Communication

dlOO

01-60  The item  communicates by transmitting emotion

to the creature carrying  or wielding  it.

61-90  The item  can  speak,  read,  and  understand one or

more languages.

91-00  The item can  speak,  read,  and  understand one

or more languages.  In  addition, the item can

communicate telepathically with  any character th a

carries or wields  it .

SENSES

With sentience comes awareness. A sentient item can

perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can

choose its senses or roll on the following table.

d4

Senses

Hearing and  normal  vision out to  30 feet.

Hearing and  norm al  vis ion  out to  60 feet

Hearing and  normal  vi sion  out to 120 feet.

Hearing and darkvisi on  out to  120 feet.

CHARACTE RI STICS

Use the information on creating NPCs in chapter 4

to  develop a sentient item's mannerisms, personality

traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. You can also draw on the

"Special Features" section earlier in  this chapter.

If you determine these characteristics randomly,

ignore or adapt any result that doesn't make sense

for an inanimate object. You  can reroll until you get a

result you like.

SPECIAL P U RPOSE

You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues,

perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the

wielder's use of the item aligns with that special

purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from

this course might cause conflict between the wielder

and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent

the use of its activated properties. You can pick a special

purpose or roll on the following table.

Purpose

Aligned: The item  seeks to defeat or destroy those

of a diametrically opposed alignment. (Such  an

item  is  never neutral.)

Bane: The item  seeks to defeat or destroy creatures

of a particular kind,  such  as  fiends,  shapechangers ,

trolls,  or wizards .

Protector: The item  seeks to defend a particular

race or kind  of creature, such as  elves  or druids.

Crusader: The  item  seeks to defeat, weaken,  or

destroy the servants of a particular deity.

Templar: The item  seeks to defend the servants

and  interests of a particular deity.

Destroyer: The item  craves destruction  and  goads

its  user to fight  arbitrarily.

Glory Seeker: The item  seeks  renown  as the

greatest magic item  in  the world , by  establishing

its  user as  a famous  or notorious figure.

Lore  Seeker: The item  craves  knowledge or is

determined to solve a mystery, learn  a secret, or

unravel  a cryptic prophecy.

Destiny Seeker: The  item  is  convinced that it and  its

wielder have  key  roles to play  in  future events.

Creator Seeker: The item  seeks  its  creator and

wants to  understand why  it was  created .



CONFLIC T

A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its

personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a

manner opposed to the item's alignment or purpose,

conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item

makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder's

Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it make

one or more of the following demands:

The item insists on being carried or worn at all times

The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything

the item finds repugnant.

The item demands that its wielder pursue the item's

goals to the exclusion of all other goals.

The item demands to be given to someone else.

If its wielder refuses to comply with the item's wishes

the item can do any or all of the following:

Make it  impossible for its wielder to attune to  it.

Suppress one or more of its activated properties.

Attempt to  take control of its wielder.

If a sentient item attempts to take control of its

wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving

throw, with a DC equal to  12 +the item's Charisma

modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by

item for  ld12 hours. While charmed , the wielder mus

try to follow the item's commands. If the wielder takes

damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effe

on a success. Whether the attempt to  control its user

succeeds or fails , the item can't use this power agai n

until the next dawn.

SAM PLE  SENTIENT ITEMS

The sentient weapons described here have storied

histories.

BLACKRAZOR

Weapon (greats word), legendary (requires attunemenc

by a creature of non-lawful alignment)

Hidden in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain,

Blackrazor shines like a piece of night sky filled with

stars. Its black scabbard is decorated with pieces of

cut obsidian.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made

with this magic weapon. It has the following  additio n ~

properties.

Devour Soul. Whenever you use it to reduce a

creature to 0  hit points, the sword slays the creature

devours its soul, unless it is a construct or an undead . . -.

creature whose soul has been devoured by Blackrazor

can be restored to life only by a  wish spell.

When it devours a soul, Blackrazor grants you

temporary hit points equal to the slain creature's hit

point maximum. These hit points fade after 24 hours.

As long as these temporary hit points last and you keep

Blackrazor in hand , you have advantage on attack roll  .

saving throws, and ability checks.

If you hit an undead with this weapon, you take ldlO

necrotic damage and the target regains ldlO hit point

If this necrotic damage reduces you to 0 hit points,

Blackrazor devours your soul.

216

CHAPTER  7  I TREASURE

Soul Hunter. While you hold  the weapon . you are

aware of the presence of Tiny or larger creatures within

60 feet of you that aren't constructs or undead.  You also

can't be charmed or frightened.

Blackrazor can cast the haste spell  on you once per

day.  It decides when to  cast the spell  and maintains

concentration on it so that you don't have to.

Sentience. Blackrazor is a sentient chaotic neutral

weapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 10, and

a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to  a

ra nge of 120 feet.

T he weapon can speak, read, and understand

Common, and can communicate with its wielder

telepathically.  Its voice is deep and echoing. While you

a re attuned to it, Blackrazor also understands every

language you know.

Personality. Blackrazor speaks with an imperious

tone, as though accustomed to being obeyed.

The sword's purpose is to  consume souls. It doesn't

care whose souls it eats, including the wielder's. The

word believes that all matter and energy sprang from

a void of negative energy and will one day return to  it.

Blackrazor is meant to hurry that process along.

Despite its nihilism, Blackrazor feels a strange

ki nship to  Wave  and Whelm, two other weapons locked

away under White Plume Mountain. It wants the three

weapons to  be united again and wielded together in

combat, even though it violently disagrees with Whelm

and finds  Wave  tedious.

Blackrazor's hunger for souls must be regularly fed.  If

the sword goes three days or more without consuming

a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the

next sunset.

M OONBLADE

Weapon (longs word), legendary (requires attunement by

an elf or half-elf of neutral good alignment)

Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the

most prized and jealously guarded is a moon blade.  In

ancient times, nearly all  elven noble houses claimed one

uch blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded

from the world, their magic lost as family lines have

become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their

bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these

weapons remain.

A moonblade passes down from  parent to child. The

sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to  that

person for  life. If the bearer dies, another heir can

claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies

dormant. It functions like a normallongsword until a

worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.

Amoonblade serves only one master at a time. The

attu nement process requires a special ritual in the

throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated

to the elven gods.

A moon blade won't serve anyone it regards as

craven,  erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving a nd

protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make

abil ity checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with

disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you

become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the

blade. Yo u remain attuned to  the weapon until you die or

the weapon is destroyed.

A moonblade has one rune on its blade for each

master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune

always grants a +1  bonus to attack and damage rolls

made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond  the

first grants the moon blade an additional property. The

DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on

the Moon Blade P roperties table.

MOONBLADE  PROPERTIES

d1 00

Property

01-40

Increase the bonu s to attack a nd  damage rolls  by

already  has a +3  bonus.

41-80  The moonblade gai ns  a  randomly determined

minor property (see "Special  Feature s"  ear li er in

this chapter).

81-82  The moonblade gains the finesse  property.

83-84  The moonblade gains the thrown  property (range

20/60 feet).

85-86  The moonblade functions  as a defender.

87-90  The moon blade  scores a critical  hit on  a  roll  of 19

or 20.

91-92  When you  hit with  an attack using the moon blade,

the attack an  extra  1d6 slashing damage.

93-94  When you  hit  a creature of a  specific  type  (such as

dragon , fiend , or undead)  with  the moonblade, the

target takes an  extra  1d6 dama ge of one of these

types: acid , cold, fire,  lightning, o r thunder.

95-96  You  can  use a  bonus action to cause the moonblade

to flash  brightly.  Each  creature that can  see you  and

is  within  30 feet of you  must succeed on a  DC  15

Constitution saving throw or become blinded for

1 minute . A creature can  repeat the saving throw

at the end of each of its turns , ending the effect

on  itself on a  success. This  property can't be used

again  until you  take a  short rest while  attuned to

the weapon .

97-98  The moonblade fun ctions as a ring of spell storing.

You  can  use an  action to call  forth  an  elfshadow,

99

provided that you  don't already have one serving

you.  The elfshadow appears  in  an  unoccupied

space within  120 feet of you.  It  uses the statistics

for  a shadow from  the Monster Manual, except it

is  neutral , immune to effects that turn  undead,

and doesn't create new shadows.  You  control

th is  c reature, deciding how it acts and  moves . It

remai ns  until  it  drops to 0  hit  points or you  dismiss

it  as an acti on .

The moonblade functions as a vorpal sword.

00

Sentience. A moon blade is a sentient neutral good

weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and

a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a

range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions,

sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand

CHAPTER 7  I TREASURE

2T7

when it wants to communicate something it has sensed.

It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or

dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.

Personality. Every moonblade seeks the advancement

of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty,

music, and life are all part of this purpose.

The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to

serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its

ideals, its loyalty is absolute.

If a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once

it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that

person should wield it,  even if the owner falls short of

elven ideals.

WAVE

Weapon (trident),  legendary (requires attunement by a

creature that worships a god of the sea)

Held in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, this

trident is an exquisite weapon engraved with images

of waves, shells, and sea creatures. Although you must

worship a god of the sea to attune to this weapon, Wave

happily accepts new converts.

You  gain a +3  bonus to attack and damage rolls made

with this magic weapon. If you score a critical hit with it,

the target takes extra necrotic damage equal to half its

hit point maximum.

The weapon also functions as a trident offish

command and a weapon of warning. It can confer the

benefit of a cap of water breathing while you hold it, and

you can use it as a cube of force  by choosing the effect,

instead of pressing cube sides to select it.

Sentience. Wave is a sentient weapon of neutral

alignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 10,

and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out

to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its

wielder and can speak, read, and understand Aquan. It

can also speak with aquatic animals as if using a speak

with animals spell, using telepathy to involve its wielder

in the conversation.

Personality. When it grows restless, Wave  has a habit

of humming tunes that vary from sea chanteys to sacred

hymns of the sea gods.

Wave  zealously desires to convert mortals to the

worship of one or more sea gods, or else to consign the

faithless to  death . Conflict arises if the wielder fails to

further the weapon's objectives in the world.

The trident has a nostalgic attachment to the

place where it was forged,  a desolate island called

Thunderforge. A sea god imprisoned a family of storm

giants there, and the giants forged  Wave  in an act of

devotion to- or rebellion against-that god.

Wave  harbors a secret doubt about its own nature and

purpose. For all its devotion to the sea gods, Wave  fears

that it was intended to bring about a particular sea god's

demise. This destiny is something Wave  might not be

able to avert.

WHELM

Weapon (warhammer), legendary (requires attunemenc

by a dwarf)

Wh elm is a powerful warhammer forged by dwarves

and lost in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain.

You gain a +3  bonus to attack and damage rolls

made with this magic weapon. At dawn the day after

you first make an attack roll with Whelm, you develop

a fear of being outdoors that persists as long as you

remain attuned to the weapon. This causes you to  have

disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability

checks while you can see the daytime sky.

Thrown Weapon.  Whelm has the thrown property,

with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60

feet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using

it,  the target takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage,  or

an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the target is a gian

Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your

hand after the attack. If you don't have a hand free,  the

weapon lands at your feet.

Shock Wave. You  can use an action to strike the

ground with  Whelm and send a shock wave out from

the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the

ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a

DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for

1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the

end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a

success. Once used, this property can't be used again

until the next dawn.

Supernatural Awareness. While you are holding

the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or

concealed doors within 30 feet of you.  In addition, you

can use an action to  cast detect evil and good or locate

object from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, yo u

can't cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn.

Sentience. Whelm is a sentient lawful neutral weapon

with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12 , and a

Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a

range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its

wielder and can speak, read, and understand Dwarvish.

Giant, and Goblin. It shouts battle cries in Dwarvish

when used in combat.

Personality.  Whelm's purpose is to slaughter giants

and goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves against

all enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy

goblins and giants or to protect dwarves.

Whelm has ties to  the dwarf clan that created it,

variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan.

It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything

to protect those dwarves from harm.

The hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries

ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for

a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a vampire. His

will was strong enough that he bent Whelm to  his evil

purposes, even killing members of his own clan.

CHAPTER  7  I TREASURE

ARTIFACTS

An artifact is a unique magic item of tremendous power,

with its own origin and history. An artifact might have

been created by gods or mortals of awesome power.

It could have been created in the midst of a crisis that

th reatened a kingdom, a world, or the entire multiverse,

and carry the weight of that pivotal moment in  hi story.

Some a rtifac ts appear when they are needed most.

For others , the  reverse is true;  when discovered, the

world trembles at the ra mifications of the find . In either

case, introducing a n artifac t into a campaign requires

fo rethought.  The artifact could be an item that opposing

s ides are hoping to  claim , or it might be something the

adventurers need to overcome their greatest challenge.

Characters  don't typically find artifacts in the

normal course of adventuri ng. In fac t, artifacts only

appear when you want them to,  fo r they a re as m uch

plot devices as magic items . Tracking down a nd

recovering an artifact is often the main goal of an

adventure. Characters mus t chase down rumors,

Monster  Manual).  Once it  obtains the artifact, the

avatar vanishes.

DESTROYING ARTIFACTS

An artifact must be destroyed in some special way.

Otherwise, it is impervious to damage.

Each artifact has a weakness by which its creation

can be undone. Learning this weakness might require

extensive research or the successful completion of a

quest. The DM decides how a particular artifact can be

destroyed. Some suggestions are provided here:

The artifact must be melted down  in the volcano,

forge,  or crucible in which it was created.

The artifact must be dropped into the River Styx.

The artifact must be swallowed and digested by the

tarrasque or some other ancient creature.

The artifact must be bathed in the blood of a god

or an angel.

The artifact must be struck and shattered by a special

weapon crafted for that purpose.

The artifact must be pulverized between the titanic

gears of Mechanus.

The artifact must be returned to its creator, who can

destroy it by touch.

SAMPLE ARTIFACTS

The artifacts presented here have appeared in one or

more of D&D worlds. Use them as guides when creating

yo ur own artifacts, or modify them as you see fit.

AxE  O F  T H E  D WARV ISH  LORDS

Weapon (battleaxe),  artifact (requires attunement)

eeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince

came to  believe that his people needed something to

unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that

would be such a symbol.

Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than

any dwarf had ever delved , the young prince came to

the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of

:\1oradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted

four great tools: the Brutal Pick, the Earthheart Forge ,

the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With

them , he forged  the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords.

Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the

dwa rf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges

and answered slights. The clans became allies, and

they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era

of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as

the First King. When he became old, he passed the

weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his

heir.  The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many

generations.

Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and

wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war

fomented by greed for  its power and the status it

bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for

the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of

chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.

Magic Weapon. The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is

a magic weapon that grants a +3  bonus to attack and

damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a

belt of dwarvenkind, a dwarven thrower, and a sword of

sharpness.

Random Properties. The axe has the following

randomly determined properties:

2 minor beneficial properties

1 major beneficial property

2 minor detrimental properties

Axe  oF  THE

DwARviSH  LoRDS

Blessings of Moradin. If you are a dwarf attuned to

the axe, you gain the following benefits:

You have immunity to poison damage.

The range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet.

You gain proficiency with artisan's tools related to

blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry.

Conjure Earth Elemental. If you are holding the axe,

you can use your action to cast the conjure elemental

spell from it, summoning an earth elemental. You can't

use this property again until the next dawn.

Travel the Depths. You can use an action to touch the

axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the

teleport spell from the axe. If your intended destination

is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or

arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this

property again until 3 days have passed.

Curse. The axe bears a curse that affects any non

dwarf that becomes attuned to  it.  Even if the attunement

ends, the curse remains. With each passing day,  the

creature's physical appearance and stature become

more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like

a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial

traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical

changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical

in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can

be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a

greater restoration or remove curse spell.

Destroying the Axe. The only way to destroy the

axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where

it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for

fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and

is consumed.

BOOK OF  EXALTED  DEEDS

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement by a

creature of good alignment)

The definitive treatise on all that is good in the

multiverse, the fabled Book of Exalted Deeds figures

prominently in many religions. Rather than being a

scripture devoted to a particular faith,  the book's various

authors filled the pages with their own vision of true

virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil.

The Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place.

As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other

corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can

bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts

have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail

to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it

offers to  those pure of heart and firm of purpose.

A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings,  .

keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature of

good alignment that is attuned to the book can release

the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened,

the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and

studying the book to digest its contents and gain its

benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book's open

pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning

and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read

from the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage

ignores resistance and immunity, and can't be reduced

or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit

points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash

is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind.

Benefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last

only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail  to

perform at least one act of kindness or generosity wit

the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil

act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book.

Random Properties. The Book of Exalted Deeds h~

the following random properties:

2 minor beneficial properties

2 major beneficial properties

Increased Wisdom. After you spend the requisite

amount of time reading and studying the book, your

Wisdom score increases by 2, to  a maximum of 24. Y  -

can't gain this benefit from the book more than once.

Enlightened Magic.  Once you've  read and studied

the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a cleric or

paladin spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher.

Halo.  Once you've read and studied the book, you

gain a protective halo. This halo sheds bright light

in a  10-foot radius and dim light for an additionallO

feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a bonus

action. While present, the halo gives you advantage on

Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with

good creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks

made to interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends

and undead within the halo's bright light make attack

rolls against you with disadvantage.

Destroying the Book. It is rumored that the Book 0:

Exalted Deeds can't be destroyed as long as good exi  ..

in the multiverse. However, drowning the book in the

River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its

pages and renders the book powerless for  ld100 years

BOOK OF VILE DARKNESS

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

The contents of this foul  manuscript of ineffable

wickedness are the meat and drink of those in evil's

thrall. No  mortal was meant to know the secrets it

contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the

scrawled pages invites madness.

Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the Book

Vile Darkness. He recorded in its pages every diseas

idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of

blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna

covered every vile topic he could, making the book a

gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs.

Other practitioners of evil have held the book and

added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge.

Their additions are clear, for  the writers of later works

stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or. 

some cases, made notations and additions to existing

text. There are places where pages are missing, torn.

or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches

that the original text can't be divined.

Nature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary

plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to

approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever

it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if th~

book rests on it long enough.

~~~

CHAPTER  7  I TREASURE

VILE  LORE

The  Book ofVile  Darkness touches on every evil  in the

cosmos. A character can  use th e lore the book contains

to unearth terrib le secrets  no morta l shoul d know. Among

the contents a character might fi nd are the following, plus

whatever else you  choose:

Vile Apotheosis . The  book could  hold a ritual that allows  a

character to become a lich  or death  knight.

True  Names. The true  names of any  number of fiends

might be  in the book.

Dark Magic. Several  spells  of horrific evil  of the  OM's

design and  choosing could  be  in the  book. Spells  could

impose dreadful  curses,  disfigure others,  require  human

sacrifice,  afflict creatures with crippling pain,  spread  vile

plagues,  and  so  on .

A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours

reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its

benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book's

contents, provided that those modifications advance evil

and expand the lore already contained within.

Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the Book

of Vile  Darkness, that creature must make a DC 17

Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's

alignment changes to  neutral evil.

The Book of Vile  Darkness remains with you only

as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you

fail  to perform at least one evil act within the span

of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the

book disappears. If you die while attuned to  the book,

an entity of great evil claims your soul. You  can't be

restored to life by any means while your soul remains

imprisoned.

Random Properties. The Book of Vile Darkness has

the following random properties:

3 minor beneficial properties

1 major beneficial property

3 minor detrimental properties

2 major detrimental properties

Adjusted Ability Scores. After you spend the

requisite amount of time reading and studying the

book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to

a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice

decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can't

adjust your ability scores again.

Mark of Darkness. After you spend the requisite

amount of time reading and studying the book, you

acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign

of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might

appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy

black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or

you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial

features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature

the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you

advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to

interact with evil creatures and Charisma (Intimidation)

checks made to interact with non-evil creatures.

Command Evil. While you are attuned to the book

and holding it, you can use an action to cast the

dominate monster spell on an evil target (save DC 18).

You can't use this property again until the next dawn.

Dark Lore. You  can reference the Book of Vile

Darkness whenever you make an Intelligence check

to recall information about some aspect of evil , such

proficiency bonus on that check.

Dark Speech. While you carry the Book of Vile

Darkness and are attuned to it, you can use an action

to recite word  from its pages in a foul  language known

as Dark S peech. Each time you do so, you take 1d12

psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within 15

feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage.

Destroying the Book. The Book of Vile  Darkness

allows pages to be torn from it,  but any evil lore

contained on those pages finds its way back into the

book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages

to the tome.

If a solar tears the book in  two, the book is destroyed

for  1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark

corner of the multiverse.

A creature attuned to the book for one hundred

years can unearth a phrase hidden in  the original text

that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud,

destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding

flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the

multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 x 100 years later.

If all evil in  the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns

to dust and is forever destroyed.

EYE AND  HAND  OF VECNA

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

Seldom is the name of Vecna spoken except in a hushed

voice. Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all

wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a

terrible empire. For all  his power, Vecna couldn't escape

his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps

to  prevent his end from ever coming about.

Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a

ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond

death, he became the greatest of allliches. Even

though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna

continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable

and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to

speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master

of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of

the Rotted Tower.

Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the

Spider Throne for himself,  or that the sword his lord

made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the

reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end

in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash.

Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye,

grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered

One's will in the world.

The Eye of Vecna  and the Hand of Vecna  might

be found  together or separately. The eye looks like a

bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a

mummified and shriveled left extremity.

To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye

and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye

grafts itself to your head and remains there until you

die.  Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye

with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is

ever removed, you die.

To attune to the hand , you must lop off your left

hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against

the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and

becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever

removed, you die.

Random Properties. The Eye of Vecna  and the Hand

ofVecna each have the following random properties:

1 minor beneficial property

to ash, and are destroyed forever. Any other attempt to

destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the artifact

reappears in one ofVecna's many hidden vaults, where

ir waits to  be rediscovered.

O RB  OF  DRAGONKIND

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

Ages past, on the world of Krynn, elves and humans

waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the

world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of

High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest

magic, forging five  Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs)

w help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken

o each of the five  towers, and there they were used to

peed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards

u  ed the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed

the dragons with powerful magic.

As the Towers of High Sorcery fell  in later ages, the

orbs were destroyed or faded into legend , and only three

are thought to s urvive.  Their magic has been warped

and twisted over the centuries, so although their

primary purpose of calling dragons still functions , they

also allow some measure of control over dragons.

Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a

presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from

. Those lacking in force of personality might find

emselves enslaved to an orb.

An  orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in

dia meter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in

ameter, and mist swi rls inside it.

While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to

xer into the orb's depths and speak its command

:ord.  You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check.

n a successful  check, you control the orb for as long

you remain attuned to it.  On a failed check, you

xcome charmed by the orb for as long as you remain

..:.  uned to  it.

EvE  AND  11AND

OF  VECNA

While you are charmed by the orb, you can't

voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts

suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you

to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon

essence within the orb might want many things: the

annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the

orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the

worship ofTakhisis (Tiamat's name on Krynn), or

something else the DM decides.

Random Properties. An Orb of Dragon kind has the

following random properties:

2 minor beneficial properties

1 minor detrimental property

1 major detrimental property

Spells. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3

expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb,

you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges

to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it:

cure wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), daylight (1

charge), death ward (2  charges), or scrying (3  charges).

You can also use an action to cast the detect magic

spell from the orb without using any charges.

Call Dragons. While you control the orb, you can use

an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call

that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons

in range feel  compelled to come to the orb as soon as

possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such

as Tiamat are unaffected by this call.  Dragons drawn to

the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them

against their will. Once you have used this property, it

can't be used again for  1 hour.

Destroying an Orb. An Orb of Dragonkind appears

fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the

attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate

spell  or one good hit from a +3  magic weapon is

sufficient to destroy an orb, however .

CHAPTER 7  I TREASURE

SwoRD  OF  KAs

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

When Vecna grew in  power, he appointed an evil and

ruthless lieutenant, Kas the Bloody Handed, to act as

his bodyguard and right hand. This despicable villain

served as advisor, warlord, and assassin. His successes

earned him Vecna's admiration and a reward: a sword

with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it.

For a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich  but

as Kas's power grew, so did his hubris. His sw;rd

urged him to supplant Vecna, .so that they could rule

the lich's empire in Vecna's stead. Legend says Vecna's

destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought

his rebellious lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's

sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby.

The Sword of Kas is a magic, sentient longsword that

grants a +3  bonus to attack and damage rolls made with

it.  It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals

an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead.

If the sword isn't bathed in  blood within 1 minute of

being drawn from  its scabbard, its wielder must make a

DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the

wielder take 3d6 psychic damage. On a failed save, the

wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the dominate

monster spell, and the sword demands that it be

bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's

demand is met.

Random Properties. The Sword of Kas has the

following random properties:

1 minor beneficial property

1 major beneficial property

1 minor detrimental property

1 major detrimental property

Spirit ofKas. While the sword is on your person, you

add a dlO to your initiative at the start of every combat.

In addition, when you use an action to attack with the

sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus r

your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remai

in effect until the start of your next turn.

Spells. While the sword is on your person, you can

use an action to cast one of the following spells (save

18) from it:  call lightning, divine word, or finger of dea d:

Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast

that spell again from it until the next dawn.

Sentience. The Sword of Kas is a sentient chaotic e\

weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and

a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to 2

range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its

wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common

Personality. The sword's purpose is to bring ruin to

Vecna. Killing Vecna's worshipers, destroying the licbs

works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill

this goal.

The Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone

corrupted by the Eye and Hand of Vecna.  The sword's

obsession with those artifacts eventually becomes a

fixation for its wielder.

Destroying the Sword. A creature attuned to both

the Eye of Vecna  and the Hand of Vecna  can use the

wish property of those combined artifacts to  unmake

the Sword of Kas. The creature must cast the wish spe

and make a Charisma check contested by the Charis

.

check of the sword. The sword must be within 30 feer

of the creature, or the spell fails. If the sword wins the

contest, nothing happens, and the wish spell is wasteC.

If the sword loses the contest, it is destroyed.

Wt>.ND  OF  0RCUS

CHAPTER  7  I TREASURE

WAND  OF  0RCUS

Wand,  artifact (requires attunement)

The ghastly Wand of Orcus rarely leaves Orcus's side.

The device, as evil as its creator, shares the demon

lord's aims to snuff out the lives of all living things and

bind the Material Plane in the stasis of undeath. Orcus

allows the wand to slip from his grasp from time to  time.

When it does, it magically appears wherever its master

senses an opportunity to achieve some fell  goal.

Made from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped

with a magically enlarged skull that once belonged to

a human hero slain by Orcus. The wand can magically

change in size to better conform to the grip of its user.

Plants wither, drinks spoil, flesh  rots, and vermin thrive

in the wand's presence.

Any creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the

wand must make a DC 17  Constitution saving throw.

On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 necrotic

damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and rises

as a zombie.

In the hands of one who is attuned to it, the wand can

be wielded as a  magic mace that grants a + 3 bonus to

attack and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals

an extra 2d12 necrotic damage on a hit.

Random Properties. The Wand of Orcus has the

following random properties:

2 minor beneficial properties

1 major beneficial property

2 minor detrimental properties

1 major detrimental property

The detrimental properties of the Wand of Orcus are

suppressed while the wand is attuned to Orcus himself.

Protection. You gain a +3  bonus to Armor Class while

holding the wand.

Spells. The wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you

can use an action and expend 1 or more of its charges

to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from

it: animate dead (1  charge), blight (2  charges), circle of

death (3  charges), finger of death (3  charges), power

word kill (4  charges), or speak with dead (1  charge). The

wand regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.

While attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower

blessed by him can cast each of the wand's spells using

2 fewer charges (minimum of 0).

Call Undead. While you are holding the wand, you

can use an action to  conjure skeletons and zombies,

calling forth as many of them as you can divide 500 hit

points among, each undead having average hit points

(see the Monster Manual for statistics). The undead

magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in

unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your

commands until they are destroyed or until dawn of

the next day, when they collapse into inanimate piles of

bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property

of the wand, you can't use it again until the next dawn.

While attuned to the wand , Orcus can summon any

kind of undead, not just skeletons and zombies. The

undead don't perish or disappear at dawn the following

day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them.

Sentience. The Wand ofOrcus is a sentient, chaotic

evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and

a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a

range of 120 feet.

The wand communicates telepathically with its

wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal

and Common.

Personality. The wand's purpose is to  help satisfy

Orcus's desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The

wand is cold, cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor.

In order to further its master's goals, the wand feigns

devotion to  its current user and makes grandiose

promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as

vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus.

Destroying the Wand.  Destroying the Wand of Orcus

requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by

the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it.  For this to

happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to  life

no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned

the hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.

Bathing the wand in positive energy causes it to crack

and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the

wand instantly reforms on Orcus's layer of the Abyss.

OTHER REWARDS

As much as adventurers desire treasure, they often

appreciate other forms of reward. This section

presents a variety of ways that gods, monarchs, and

other beings of power might recognize the characters'

accomplishments, including supernatural gifts that

give characters new capabilities; titles, lands, and other

marks of prestige; and boons that are available only to

adventurers who have reached 20th level.

SUPERNATURAL  GIFTS

A supernatural gift is a special reward granted

by a being or force of great magical power. Such

supernatural gifts come in two forms : blessings and

charms. A blessing is usually bestowed by a god or

a godlike being. A charm is typically the work of a

powerful spirit, a location of ancient magic, or a creature

that has legendary actions. Unlike a magic item, a

supernatural gift isn't an object and doesn't require

attunement. It gives a character an extraordinary ability,

which can be used one or more times.

BLESSINGS

A character might receive a  blessing from a deity for

doing something truly momentous-an accomplishment

that catches the attention of both gods and mortals.

Killing rampaging gnolls rarely warrants such a

blessing, but slaying the high priest of Tiamat as he

attempts to summon the Dragon Queen might.

A blessing is an appropriate reward for one of the

following accomplishments:

Restoring the most sacred shrine of a god

Foiling an earthshaking plot by the enemies of a god

Helping a god's favored servant complete a holy quest

An adventurer might also receive a blessing in

advance of a perilous quest. For example, a paladin

could receive one before setting out on a quest to slay a

terrifying lich that is responsible for a magical plague

sweeping the land.

CHAPTER 7  I TREASURE

227

A character should receive only a blessing that is

useful to him or her,  and some blessings come with

expectations on the part of the benefactor. A god

typically gives a  blessing for a particular purpose, such

as recovering a  holy person's remains or toppling a

tyrannical empire. The god might revoke a blessing

if a character fails to pursue that purpose or acts

counter to  it.

A character retains the benefits of a blessing forever or

until it is taken away by the god who granted it.  Unlike

a magic item, such a blessing can't be suppressed by an

anti magic field or similar effect.

Most adventurers go  their entire lives without

receiving even one of these blessings. There is no limit

on the number of blessings a character can receive,

but it should be rare for a character to  have more than

one at a time. Moreover, a character can't benefit from

multiple instances of a blessing at the same time. For /

example,  a character can't benefit from two instances ,,s>f

the Blessing of Health at once.

Example blessings are provided below. The text of a

blessing addresses its user. If you decide to create more

blessings, consider this: a typical blessing mimics the

properties of a wondrous item.

Blessing of Health. Your Constitution score increases

by 2,  up to a  maximum of 22.

Blessing of Protection. You  gain a +1  bonus to AC

and saving throws.

Blessing of Magic Resistance. You  have advantage on

saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Blessing of Understanding. Your Wisdom score

increases by 2, up to a maximum of 22.

Blessing ofValhaJJa. This blessing grants you the

power to  summon spirit warriors, as if you had blown a

silver horn of Valhalla.  Once you use this blessing, you

can't use it again until 7 days have passed.

Blessing of Weapon Enhancement. One nonmagical

weapon in your possession becomes a +1  weapon

whenever you wield it.

Blessing of Wound Closure. This blessing grants you

the benefits of a periapt of wound closure.

CHARMS

A charm is a minor supernatural gift, which can

be received in a large variety of ways. For example,

a wizard who finds an eldritch secret in a dead

arch mage's spellbook might be infused with the magic

of a charm, as might a character who solves a sphinx's

riddle or drinks from a magic fountain. Legendary

creatures, such as ancient gold dragons and unicorns,

sometimes grace their allies with charms, and some

explorers find themselves bearing the magic of a charm

after discovering a long-lost location that is drenched in

primeval magic.

Some charms can be used only once, and others can

be used a specific number of times before vanishing. If a

charm lets you cast a spell, you are able to do so without

spending a spell slot or providing any components

(verbal, somatic, or material). In any case, a charm can't

be used in the area created by an antimagic field  or a

similar effect, and a charm's effects are susceptible to

dispel magic and the like. But the charm itself can't be

CHAPTER  7  I TREASURE

removed from  a creature by anything short of divine

intervention or the wish spell.

Example charms are provided below. The text of a

charm addresses its user. A typical charm mimics the

effects of a potion or a spell, so it is easy to  create more

charms of your own , if you  like.

Charm of Animal Conjuring. This charm allows

you to  cast the conjure animals spell (3rd-level version

as an action. Once used three times, the charm

vanishes from you.

Charm ofDarkvision. This charm allows you to

cast the darkvision spell as an action, no components

required. Once used three times, the charm goes awa_

Charm of Feather FaJJing.  This charm grants you  -

benefits of a ring of feather falling.  These benefits last

for  10 days, after which the charm vanishes from you.

Charm of Heroism. This charm allows you to give

yourself the benefit of a potion of heroism as an action.

Once you  do so, the charm vanishes from you.

Charm of Restoration. This charm has 6 charges.

You can use an action to expend some of its charges

to cast one of the following spells: greater restoration

(4 charges) or Jesser restoration (2  charges). Once

all  its charges have been expended, the charm

vanishes from you.

Charm of the Slayer. One sword in your possession

becomes a dragon slayer or giant slayer (DM's choice)

for  the next 9 days. The charm then vanishes from you

and the weapon returns to  normal.

Charm of Vitality. This charm allows you to give

yourself the benefit of a potion of vitality as an action.

Once you do so, the charm vanishes from you.

MARKS  OF  PRESTIGE

Sometimes the most memorable reward for  adventure~

is the prestige that they acquire throughout a realm.

Their adventures often earn them fame and power,

allies and enemies, and titles that they can pass on to

their descendants. Some lords and ladies began as

commoners who ventured into the dangerous places oi

the world and made names for themselves through the -

brave deeds.

This section details the most common marks of

prestige that adventures might acquire during a

campaign. These marks are usually gained along with

treasure, but sometimes they stand on their own .

LETTERS  OF  RECOMMENDATION

When gold is in short supply, the adventurers'

benefactor might provide them with a letter of

recommendation instead of monetary payment. Such a

letter is usually enclosed in a  handsome folio,  case, or

scroll tube for safe transport, and it usually bears the

signature and seal of whoever wrote it.

A letter of recommendation from a person of

impeccable reputation can grant adventurers access

to NPCs that they would otherwise have trouble

meeting on their own, such as a duke, viceroy, or queen.

Moreover, carrying such a recommendation on one's

person can help clear up "misunderstandings" with

local authorities who might not otherwise take the

adventurers at their word .

A letter of recommendation is worth only as much as

the person who wrote it and offer  no benefit  in places

where its writer holds no sway.

MEDALS

Although they are often fash ioned from gold  and

other precious materials, medals have an even greater

symbolic value to those who awa rd and receive them.

Medals are typically awarded by powerful political

figures for acts of heroism , a nd wearing a medal

is usually enough to  earn the respect of those who

understand its significance.

Different acts of heroism can warrant different

kinds of medals. The King of Breland (in  the Eberron

campaign setting) might award a Royal Badge of Valor

(shaped like a shield and made of ruby and electrum)

to adventurers for defending Brei ish citizens, while

the Golden Bear of Breland (a  medal made of gold and

shaped in a likeness of a bear's head, with gems for

eyes) might be reserved for adventurers who prove their

allegiance to  the Brelish Crown by uncovering and

defeating a plot to end the Treaty of Thronehold and

reignite the Last War.

A medal doesn't offer a specific in-game benefit to  one

who wears it,  but it can affect dealings with NPCs. For

example, a character who proudly displays the Golden

Bear of Breland will be regarded as a hero of the people

within the kingdom of Breland. Outside Breland, the

medal carries far less weight, except among allies of

Breland's  king.

PARCELS  OF  LAND

A parcel of land is just that, and usually comes with a

royal letter affirming that the land has been granted as a

reward for some service. Such land usually remains the

property of the local ruler or ruling body, but is leased

to  a character with the understanding that it can be

taken away, especially if his or her loyalty is ever called

into question.

A parcel of land, if sufficiently large, might have one or

more farms or villages on it already, in which case the

recipient is pronounced lord or lady of the land and is

expected to collect taxes, along with any other duties.

A character who receives a parcel of land is free to

build on it and is expected to safeguard it.  He or she may

yield the land as part of an inheritance, but can't sell

or trade it without permission from the local ruler or

ruling body.

Parcels of land make fine rewards for adventurers

who are looking for a place to settle or who have family

or some kind of personal investment in the region where

the land is located.

SPECIAL FAVORS

A reward might come in the form of a favor that the

characters can call on at some future date. Special

favors work best when the individual granting them is

trustworthy. A lawful good or lawful neutral NPC will

do whatever can be done to fulfill  an obligation when

the time comes, short of breaking laws. A lawful evil

NPC does the same, but only because a deal is a deal.

A neutral good or neutral  PC might pay off favors to

protect his or her reputation. A chaotic good NPC is

CHAPTER  7  I TREASURE

moreconcerned about doing right by the adventurers,

honoring any obligations without worrying too much

about personal risk or adherence to  the law.

SPECIAL RIGHTS

A politically powerful person can reward characters by

giving them special rights, which are usually articulated

in some sort of official document. For example,

characters might be granted special rights  to  carry

weapons in public places, kill enemies of the crown, or

negotiate on a duke's behalf. They might earn the right

to demand free room and board from any establishment

within a particular community, or have the right to draft

local militia to assist them as needed.

Special rights last only as long as the legal document

dictates, and such rights can be revoked if the

adventurers abuse them.

STRONGHOLDS

A stronghold is a reward usually given to seasoned

adventurers who demonstrate unwavering fealty to a"

powerful political figure or ruling body, such as a king,

a knighthood, or a council of wizards. A stronghold

can be anything from a fortified tower in the heart of

a city to a provincial keep on the borderlands. While

the stronghold is for the characters to govern as they

see fit, the land on which it sits remains the property of

the crown or local ruler. Should the characters prove

disloyal or unworthy of the gift, they can be asked or

forced to relinquish custody of the stronghold.

As an additional reward, the individual bequeathing

the stronghold might offer to pay its maintenance cost

for a period of one or more months, after which the

characters inherit that responsibility. See chapter 6 for

more information on stronghold maintenance.

TITLES

A politically powerful figure has the ability to dispense

titles. A title often comes with a parcel of land (see

above). For example, a character might be awarded the

title Earl of Storm river or Countess of Dun Fjord, along

with a parcel of land that includes a settlement or region

of the same name.

A character can hold more than one title, and in a

feudal society, those titles can be passed down to (or

distributed among) one's children. While a character

holds a title, he or she is expected to act in a manner

befitting that title. By decree, titles can be stripped away

if the local ruler or ruling body has reason to question

the character's loyalty or competence.

ALTERNATIVES  TO  EPIC  BOONS

You  might decide to grant one of the following  rewards to a

20th-level  character,  instead of awarding an  epic boon. These

two options can  be awarded to a character more than once.

Ability Score  Improvement. The character can  increase one

ability score by  2 or incre ase two  ability scores by  l  each.

The ability score can  now  be  increased above 20, up to a

maximum of 30.

New Feat. The character gains a  new feat chosen  by the

player, but subject to your approval.

,.

CHAPTER  7  I TREASURE

TRAINING

A character might be offered  pecial training in lieu of

a financial reward. This kind of training isn't widely

available and thus is highly desirable. It  presu mes

the existence of a skilled trainer-perhaps a retired

adventurer or champion who is willing to serve as a

mentor. The trainer might be a reclusive wizard or

haughty sorcerer who owes the queen a favor,  the

knight-commander of the King's Guard, the leader of

a powerful druid circle, a quirky monk who lives in a

remote mountaintop pagoda, a barbarian chieftain , a

warlock living among nomads as a fo rtune-teller, or an

absentminded bard whose plays and poetry are known

throughout the land.

A character who agrees to training as a reward must

spend downtime with the trainer (see chapter 6 for

more information on downtime activities). In exchange,

the character is guaranteed to  receive a special benefit.

Possible training benefits include the following:

The character gains inspiration daily at dawn for

ld4 + 6 days.

The character gains proficiency in a skill.

The character gains a feat.

EPIC  BOONS

An epic boon is a special power available only to 20th

level characters. Characters at that level gain such

boons only if you want them to and only when you feel

it's appropriate. Epic boons are best awarded after

the characters complete a major quest, or accomplish

something else particularly notable. A character might

gain an epic boon after destroying an evil artifact,

defeating an ancient dragon, or halting an incursion

from the Outer Planes.

Epic boons can also be used as a form of

advancement, a way to provide greater power to

characters who have no more levels to gain. With this

approach, consider awarding one epic boon to each

character for every 30,000 XP he or she earns above

355,000 XP.

You determine which epic boon a character gains.

Ideally, the boon you pick is something the character

would put to use in future adventures. You can allow a

player to select a boon for his or her character, subject to

your approval.

Whatever boon a character ends up with, consider its

place in your story and world. Many of the boons are

extraordinary and represent the gradual transformation

of a character into something resembling a demigod.

The acquisition of a boon might visibly transform a

character. For example, the eyes of a character with

the Boon of True sight might glow when he or she feels

strong emotion, and a character who has the Boon of

High Magic might have faint motes of light glimmering

around his or her head. Also, decide how the boon first

appears. Does the boon appear spontaneously and

mysteriously? Or does a being of cosmic power manifest

to bestow it? The bestowal of a boon can itself be an

exciting scene in an adventure.

The text of a boon addresses its user. Unless a boon

says otherwise, a character can't gain it more than once.







BooN OF  CoMBAT PROWESS

When you miss with a melee weapon attack, you can

choose to hit instead. Once you use this boon, you can't

use it again until you finish a short rest.

CHAPTER  7  I TREASURE

CHAPTER 8:  RUNNING THE  GAME

ULES ENABLE YOU AND YOUR PLAYERS TO HAV E

fun at the table. The rules serve you, not vice

versa. There are the rules of the game, and

there are table rules for  how the game is

played. For instance, players need to  know

what happens when one of them misses a

session. They need to know whether to bring

m iniatures, any special rules you've  decided to use, and

how to treat a cocked die (a die that lands so that its

face can't be clearly read). These topics and more are

covered in this chapter.

TABLE  RULES

Ideally, players come to  the gaming table with the same

goal: to have a fun time together. This section gives

recommendations for  table rules you can establish to

help  meet that goal. Here are some fundamentals:

Foster respect. Don't bring personal conflicts to  the

table or let disagreements escalate into bad feelings.

Don't touch others' dice if they're sensitive about it.

Avoid distractions. Turn off the television and video

games. If you have young children , hire a babysitter.

Reducing distractions helps players stay in character

and enjoy the story. It might be fine to have players

wandering away from the table and back, but some

players prefer planned breaks.

Have snacks. Decide before a session who will bring

food  and drink. This is often something the players

can handle.

TABLE  TALK

monster hits all the time, is it of a much higher level

than the characters, or are you rolling high numbers?

Rolling behind a screen lets you fudge the results if

you want to. If two critical hits in a row would kill a

character, you could change the second critical hit

into a normal hit,  or even a miss. Don't distort die rolls

too often, though , and don't let on that you're doing it.

Otherwise, your players might think they don't face

any real risks-or worse, that you're playing favorites.

A roll behind a screen can help preserve mystery. For

example, if a player thinks there might be someone

invisible nearby and makes a Wisdom (Perception)

check, consider rolling a die behind the screen even if

no one is there, making the player think someone is,

indeed, hiding. Try not to overuse this trick.

You  might choose to make a roll for a player because

you don't want the player to know how good the check

total is. For example, if a player suspects a baroness

might be charmed and wants to  make a Wisdom

(Insight) check, you could make the roll in secret for

the player. If the player rolled and got a high number

but didn't sense anything amiss, the player would be

confident that the baroness wasn't charmed. With a

low roll, a negative answer wouldn't mean much. A

hidden roll allows uncertainty.

ROLLING ATTACKS  AND  DAMAGE

Players are accustomed to rolling an attack roll first

and then a damage roll. If players make attack rolls and

damage rolls at the same time, the action moves a little

faster around the table.

Set expectations about how players talk at the table:

RULES  DISCUSSIONS

Make it clear who's speaking: the character or the

player (out of character).

Decide how you feel about a player sharing

information that his or her character wouldn't know or

that the character is incapable of sharing as a result of

being unconscious, dead, or far away.

Are you all right with players retracting what they just

said their characters did?

DICE  ROLLING

Establish expectations about rolling dice. Rolling in full

view of everyone is a good starting point. If you see a

player rolling and scooping the dice up before anyone

else can see, encourage that player to be less secretive.

When a die falls on the floor,  do you count it or reroll

it? When it lands cocked against a book, do you pull the

book away and see where it lands, or re~;oll it?

What about you,  the DM? Do you make your rolls in

the open or hide them behind a DM screen? Consider

the following:

If you roll dice where the players can see, they know

you're playing impartially and not fudging rolls.

Rolling behind a screen keeps the players guessing

about the strength of their opposition. When a

You  might need to set a policy on rules discussions at

the table. Some groups don't mind putting the game

on hold while they hash out different interpretations

of a rule. Others prefer to let the DM make a call and

continue with the action. If you gloss over a  rules issue

in play, make a note of it (a good task to delegate to a

player) and return to the issue later.

METAGAME  THINKING

Metagame thinking means thinking about the game as

a game.  It's like when a character in a movie knows it's a

movie and acts accordingly. For example, a player might

say, "The DM wouldn't throw such a powerful monster

at us!" or you might hear, "The read-aloud text spent a

lot of time describing that door- let's search it again! "

Discourage metagame thinking by giving players a

gentle reminder: "What do your characters think?" You

can curb metagame thinking by setting up situations

that will be difficult for the characters and that might

require negotiation or retreat to survive.

MISSING  PLAYERS

How should you deal with the characters of missing

players? Consider these options:

CHAPTER  8  I  RUNN lNG THE  GAME

Have another player run the missing player's

character. The player running the extra character

should strive to keep the character alive and use

resources wisely.

Run the character yourself. It's an extra burden for

you, but it can work.

Decide the character isn't there. Invent a good reason

for the character to miss the adventure, perhaps

by having him or her linger in town or continue a

downtime activity. Leave a way for  the character to

rejoin the party when the player returns.

Have the character fade into the background. This

solution requires everyone to step out of the game

world a bit and suspend disbelief, but might be the

easiest solution. You  act as if the character's not there,

but don't try to come up with any in-game explanation

for  this absence. Monsters don't attack the character,

who returns the favor.  On returning, the player

resumes playing as if he or she was never gone.

SMALL  GROUPS

Most of the time, each player runs one character.

The game plays best that way, without overwhelming

anyone. But if your group is small, players can control

more than one character. Or you can fill  out the group

with NPC followers,  using the guidelines in chapter 4,

"Creating Nonplayer Characters." You can also make

the characters more resilient by using the healing surge

option in chapter 9,  "Dungeon Master's Workshop."

Don't force a reluctant player to  take on multiple

characters, and don't show favoritism by allowing only

one player to do so. If one character is the mentor of

the other, the player can focus on roleplaying just one

character. Otherwise, players can end up awkwardly

talking to themselves in character, or avoiding

roleplaying a ltogether.

Multiple characters can be a good idea in a game

that features nonstop peril and a high rate of character

death. If your group agrees to the premise, have each

player keep one or two additional characters on hand,

ready to jump in whenever the current character dies.

Each time the main character gains a level, the backup

characters do as well.

NEW PLAYERS - - - - - -

When a new player joins the group, allow the new

player to create a character of a level equal to the

lowest-level member of the party. The only exception

to this guideline is when the new player is completely

unfamiliar with the D&D game. In that case, have that

player start with a  1st-level character. If the rest of tlie

party is significantly higher in level, consider taking a

short break from the campaign and having everyone

play a  1st-level character for a few sessions while the

new player learns the ropes.

Integrating a new character into the group can be

difficult if the party is in the middle of an adventure. The

following approaches can help make it easier:

CHAPTER  8  I RUNNING THE. GAME

The new character is a friend or relative of one of the

adventurers who has been searching for  the group.

The new character is a prisoner of the foes the other

characters are fighting. When rescued, this character

joins their group.

The new character is the sole survivor of another

adventuring group.

THE  ROLE  OF  DICE

Dice are neutral arbiters. They can determine the

outcome of an action without assigning any motivation

to the DM and without playing favorites . The extent to

which you use them is entirely up to you.

ROLLING WITH  IT

Some DMs rely on die rolls for almost everything. Whe

a character attempts a task, the DM calls for a check a

picks a DC. As a DM  using this style, you can't rely on

the characters succeeding or failing on any one check

to  move the action in a specific direction. You must be

ready to improvise and react to a changing situation.

Relying on dice also gives the players the sense that

anything is possible. Sure, it might seem unlikely that

the party's hal fling can leap on the ogre's  back, pull a

sack over its head, and then dive to safety, but with a

lucky enough roll it just might work.

A drawback of this approach is that roleplaying

can diminish if players feel  that their die rolls, rather

than their decisions and characterizations, always

determine success.

IGNORING THE  DICE

One approach is to  use dice as rarely as possible. Some

DMs use them only during combat, and determine

success or failure as they like in other situations.

With this approach, the DM decides whether an action

or a plan succeeds or fails based on how well the player:

make their case, how thorough or creative they are, or

other factors. For example, the players might describe

how they search for a secret door, detailing how they

tap on a wall or twist a torch sconce to find  its trigger.

That could be enough to convince the DM that they

find  the secret door without having to  make an ability

check to  do so.

This approach rewards creativity by encouraging

players to look to the situation you've described for an

answer, rather than looking to their character sheet or

their character's special abilities. A downside is that no

DM is completely neutral. ADM might come to favor

certain players or approaches, or even work against

good ideas if they send the game in a direction he or she

doesn't like. This approach can also slow the game if the

DM focuses on one "correct" action that the characters

must describe to overcome an obstacle.

THE  MIDDLE  PATH

Many DMs find  that using a combination of the two

approaches works best. By balancing the use of dice

against deciding on success, you can encourage your

players to strike a balance between relying on their

bonuses and abilities and paying attention

to the ga me and immersing themselves in

its world.

Remember that dice don't run your

game- you do. Dice are like rules. They're

tools to  help keep the action moving. At any

time, you can decide that a player's action is

automatically successful. You can also grant

the player advantage on any ability check,

reducing the chance of a bad die roll foiling the

character's plans. By the same token, a bad plan

or unfortunate circumstances can transform the

easiest task into an impossibility, or at least impose

disadvantage.

USING ABILITY SCORES

When a player wants to do something, it's often

appropriate to let the attempt succeed without a roll

or a reference to the character's ability scores. For

example, a character doesn't normally need to make

a Dexterity check to walk across an empty room or a

Charisma check to order a mug of ale. Only call for a

roll if there is a meaningful consequence for failure.

When deciding whether to  use a roll, ask yourself two

questions:

Is a  task so easy and so free of conflict and stress that

there should be no chance of failure?

Is a task so inappropriate or impossible- such as

hitting the moon with an arrow-that it can't work?

If the answer to  both of these questions is no, some kind

of roll is appropriate. The following sections provide

guidance on determining whether to call for an ability

check, attack roll, or saving throw; how to assign DCs;

when to  use advantage and disadvantage; and other

related topics.

ABILITY CHECKS

An ability check is a test to see whether a character

succeeds at a task that he or she has decided to attempt.

The Player's Handbook includes examples of what

each ability score is used for. The Ability Checks table

summarizes that material for easy reference.

MULTIPLE ABILITY CHECKS

Sometimes a character fails an ability check and

wants to  try again. In some cases, a character is free

to  do so; the only real cost is the time it takes. With

enough attempts and enough time, a character should



eventually succeed at the task. To speed things up,

assume that a character spending ten times the normal

amount of time needed to complete a task automatically

succeeds at that task. However, no amount of repeating

the check allows a character to turn an impossible task

into a successful one.

In other cases, failing an ability check makes it

impossible to  make the same check to do the same thing

again. For example, a  rogue might try to trick a town

guard into thinking the adventurers are undercover

agents of the king. If the rogue loses a contest of

Charisma (Deception) against the guard's Wisdom

(Insight), the same lie told again won't work. The

characters can come up with a different way to get past

the guard or try the check again against another guard

at a different gate. But you might decide that the initial

failure makes those checks more difficult to pull off.

CHAPTER  8  I RUNNING THE  GAME

237

CONTESTS

A contest is a kind of ability check that matches

two creatures against each other. Use a contest if a

character attempts something that either directly foils

or is directly opposed by another creature's efforts. In a

contest, the ability checks are compared to each other,

rather than to a target number.

When you call for a contest, you pick the ability that

each side must use, deciding whether both sides use the

same ability or whether different abilities should counter

each other. For example, when a creature tries to  hide, it

engages in a contest of Dexterity against Wisdom. But if

two creatures arm wrestle, or if one creature is holding

a door closed against another's attempt to push it open,

both use Strength.

ATTACK ROLLS

----

-----------

Call for an attack roll when a character tries to hit a

creature or an object with an attack, especially when

the attack could be foiled  by the target's armor or shield

or by another object providing cover. You can also use

attack rolls to resolve noncombat activities such as

archery contests or a game of darts.

SAVING THROWS

A saving throw is an instant response to  a harmful effect

and is almost never done by choice. A save makes the

most sense when something bad happens to a character

and the character has a chance to avoid that effect. An

ability check is something a character actively attempts

to accomplish, whereas a saving throw is a split-second

response to the activity of someone or something else.

Most of the time, a saving throw comes into play when

an effect-such as a spell , monster ability, or trap-calls

for  it,  telling you what kind of saving throw is involved

and providing a DC for it.

Other times, a situation arises that clearly calls for a

saving throw, especially when a character is subjected

to a harmful effect that can't be hedged out by armor or

a shield. It's up to you to decide which ability score is

involved. The Saving Throws table offers suggestions.

INTELLIGENCE CHECK  VS.  WISDOM  CHECK

If you  have trouble deciding whether to call  for  an  Intelli

gence or a Wisdom check to determine whether a character

notices something, think of it  in  terms of what a very  high  or

low  score in  those two  abilities  might mean.

A character with  a high Wisdom  but low  Intelli ge nce  is

aware of the surroundings but is  bad  at interpreting what

things  mean. The character might spot that one section  of

a wall  is  clean  and  dusty compared to the others, but he or

she wouldn't necessarily make the deduction that a secret

door is  there.

In  contrast,  a character with  high  Intelligence and  low

Wisdom  is  probably oblivious  but clever. The character might

not spot the clean  section of wall  but,  if asked  about it,  could

immediately deduce why  it's  clean.

Wisdom  checks allow characters to  perceive what is

around them  (the wall  is  clean  here), while  Intelligence

checks answer why things are that way  (there's  probably a

secret door).

DIFFICULTY CLASS

It's your job to  establish the Difficulty Class for an abi li  _

check or a saving throw when a rule or an adventure

change such established DCs. When you do so, think o:

how difficult a task is and then pick the associated DC

from the Typical DCs table.

The numbers associated with these categories of

difficulty are meant to be easy to keep in your head,

so that you don't have to  refer to this book every time

you decide on a DC. Here are some tips for  using DC

categories at.the gaming table.

If you've decided that an ability check is called for,

then most likely the task at hand isn't a very easy

one. Most people can accomplish a DC 5 task with

little chance of failure. Unless circumstances are

unusual, let characters succeed at such a task without

making a check.

Then ask yourself, "Is this task's difficulty easy,

moderate, or hard?" If the only DCs you ever use are 1C

15, and 20, your game will run just fine.  Keep in mind

that a character with a  10 in the associated ability and

no proficiency will succeed at an easy task around 50

percent of the time. A moderate task requires a higher

score or proficiency for success, whereas a hard task

typically requires both. A big dose of luck with the d2 0

also doesn't hurt.

If you find yourself thinking, "This task is especially

hard," you can use a higher DC, but do so with caution

and consider the level of the characters. A DC 25 task

is very hard for low-level characters to accomplish, bu

it becomes more reasonable after lOth level or so. A

DC 30 check is nearly impossible for most low-level

characters. A 20th-level character with proficiency and -

relevant ability score of 20 still needs a 19 or 20 on the

die roll to succeed at a task of this difficulty.

VARIANT:  AUTOMATIC  SUCCESS

Sometimes the randomness of a d20 roll  leads to

ludicrous results. Let's say a door requires a successful

DC 15 Strength check to be battered down. A fighter

with a Strength of 20 might helplessly flail  against the

door because of bad die rolls. Meanwhile, the rogue with

a Strength of 10 rolls a 20 and knocks the door from

its hinges.

If such results bother you, consider allowing

automatic success on certain checks. Under this

optional rule, a character automatically succeeds on any

ability check with a DC less than or equal to the relevant

ability score minus 5. So in the example above, the

fighter would automatically kick in the door. This rule

doesn't apply to contests, saving throws, or attack rolls.

Having proficiency with a skill or tool can also

grant automatic success. If a character's proficiency

bonus applies to his or her ability check, the character

automatically succeeds if the DC is 10 or less. If that

character is 11th level or higher, the check succeeds if

the DC is 15 or less.

The downside of this whole approach is its

predictability. For example, once a character's ability

score reaches 20, checks of DC 15 and lower using that

ability become automatic successes. Smart players

will then always match the character with the highest

ability score against any given check. If you want some

risk of failure, you need to  set higher DCs. Doing this,

though, can aggravate the problem you're trying to solve:

higher DCs require higher die rolls, and thus rely even

more on luck.

PROFICIENCY

When you ask a player to  make an ability check,

consider whether a skill or tool proficiency might apply

to it.  The player might also ask you if a particular

proficiency applies.

One way to think about this question is to consider

whether a character could become better at a particular

task through training and practice. If the answer is

no, it's fine  to  say that no proficiency applies. But if

the answer is yes, assign an appropriate skill or tool

proficiency to reflect that training and practice.

SKILLS

As described in the Player's Handbook, a skill

proficiency represents a character's focus on one

aspect of an ability. Among all the things a character's

Dexterity score describes, the character might be

particularly skilled at sneaking around, reflected in

proficiency in the Stealth skill. When that skill is used

for an ability check, it is usually used with Dexterity.

Under certain circumstances, you can decide a

character's proficiency in a skill can be applied to  a

different ability check. For example, you might decide

that a character forced to swim from an island to the

mainland must succeed on a Constitution check (as

opposed to a Strength check) because of the distance

involved. The character is proficient in the Athletics

skill, which covers swimming, so you allow the

character's proficiency bonus to apply to this ability

check. In effect, you're asking for a Constitution

(Athletics) check, instead of a Strength (Athletics) check.

Often, players ask whether they can apply a skill

proficiency to an ability check. If a player can provide

a good justification for why a character's training and

aptitude in a skill should apply to  the check, go ahead

and allow it, rewarding the player's creative thinking.

TOOLS

Having proficiency with a tool allows you  to  apply

your proficiency bonus to an ability check you make

using that tool. For example, a character proficient

with carpenter's tools can apply his or her proficiency

bon.us to a Dexterity check to craft a wooden flute,  an

Intelligence check to craft a wooden secret door, or a

Strength check to build a working trebuchet. However,

the proficiency bonus wouldn't apply to an ability check

made to identify unsafe wooden construction or to

discern the origin of a crafted item, since neither check

requires tool  use.

SAVING THROWS  AND ATTACK ROLLS

Characters are either proficient with a saving throw

or attack, or they aren't. The bonus always applies if a

character is proficient.

ADVANTAGE  AND  DISADVANTAGE

Advantage and disadvantage are among the most useful

tools in your DM's toolbox. They reflect temporary

circumstances that might affect the chances of a

character succeeding or failing at a task. Advantage

is also a great way to reward a player who shows

exceptional creativity in play.

Characters often gain advantage or disadvantage

through the use of special abilities, actions, spells, or

other features of their classes or backgrounds. In other

cases, you decide whether a circumstance influences a

roll in one direction or another, and you grant advantage

or impose disadvantage as a result.

Consider granting advantage when  000

Circumstances not related to  a creature's inherent

capabilities provide it with an edge.

Some aspect of the environment contributes to the

character's chance of success.

A player shows exceptional creativity or cunning in

attempting or describing a task.

Previous actions (whether taken by the character

making the attempt or some other creature) improve

the chances of success.

Consider imposing disadvantage when  000

Circumstances hinder success in some way.

Some aspect of the environment makes success less

likely (assuming that aspect doesn't already impose a

penalty to the roll being made).

An  element of the plan or description of an action

makes success less likely.

Because advantage and disadvantage cancel each

other out, there's no need to keep track of how many

circumstances weigh on both sides.

CHAPTER  8  I RUNNING  THE  GAME

For example, imagine a wizard is running down a

dungeon cor~idor to escape from a beholder. Around

the corner ahead, two ogres lie in wait. Does the wizard

hear the ogres readying their ambush? You  look at

the wizard's passive Wisdom (Perception) score and

consider all the factors weighing on it.

The wizard is running, not paying attention to what's

ahead of him. This imposes disadvantage on the

wizard's  ability check. However, the ogres are readying

a portcullis trap and making a lot of noise with a winch,

which could grant the wizard advantage on the check.

As a result, the character has neither advantage nor

disadvantage on the Wisdom check, and you don't need

to  consider any additional factors.  Past encounters with

an ogre ambush, the fact that the wizard's ears are

still ringing from  the thunderwave spell he cast at the

beholder, the overall noise level of the dungeon- none of

that matters any more. They all cancel out.

INSPIRATION

Awarding inspiration is an effective way to  encourage

roleplaying and risk-taking. As explained in the Player's

Handbook, having inspiration gives a character an

obvious benefit: being able to gain advantage on one

ability check, attack roll , or saving throw. Remember

that a character can have no more than one inspiration

at a time.

AWARDING  INSPIRATION

Think of inspiration as a spice that you can use to

enhance your campaign. Some DMs forgo using

inspiration, while others embrace it as a key part of

the game. If you take away anything from this section ,

remember this golden rule: inspiration should make the

game more enjoyable for everyone. Award inspiration

when players take actions that make the game more

exciting, amusing, or memorable.

As a rule of thumb, aim to  award inspiration to each

character about once per session of play.  Over time, you

might want to  award inspiration more or less often, at

a rate that works best for your table. You  might use the

same rate for your entire DMing career, or you might

change it with each campaign.

Offering inspiration as a reward encourages certain

types of behavior in your players. Think of your style as

a DM and your group's preferences. What helps make

the game more fun  for your group? What type of action

fit  in with your campaign's style or genre? Your answer

to those questions help determine when you award

inspiration.

Roleplaying. Using inspiration to reward roleplaying

is a good place to start for most groups. Reward a

player with inspiration when that player causes his or

her character to do something that is consistent with

the character's personality trait, flaw, or bond. The

character's action should be notable in some way. It

might drive the story forward , push the adventurers into

danger, or make everyone at the table laugh. In essence.

you reward the player for roleplaying in a way that

makes the game more enjoyable for everyone else.

Take into account each player's roleplaying style, and

try not to  favor one style over another. For example,

Allison might be comfortable speaking in an accent and

adopting her character's mannerisms, but Paul feels

self-conscious when trying to act and prefers to describe

his character~s attitude and actions. Neither style is

better than the other. Inspiration encourages players to

take part and make a good effort, and awarding it fairly

makes the game better for everyone.

Heroism. You can use inspiration to encourage

player characters to take risks. A fighter might not

normally hurl himself over a balcony to land in the mid

of a pack of hungry ghouls, but you can reward the

character's daring maneuver with inspiration. Such a

reward tells the players that you want them to embrace

swashbuckling action.

This approach is great for campaigns that emphasize

action-packed heroics. For such campaigns, consider

allowing inspiration to  be spent after a d20 roll, rather

than before. This approach turns inspiration into a

cushion against failure-and a guarantee that it comes

into play only when a player is faced directly by failure.

Such an assurance makes risky tactics less daunting.

A Reward for Victory.  Some DMs prefer to play an

impartial role in their campaigns. Inspiration normally

requires a DM's judgment to  award, which might

run against your style if you like a campaign where

you let dice determine most outcomes. If that's your

s tyle, consider using inspiration as a reward when

the characters achieve an important goal or victory,

representing a surge of confidence and energy.

Under this model, give everyone in the party

inspiration if the characters manage to defeat a

powerful foe , execute a cunning plan to achieve a

goal, or otherwise overcome a daunting obstacle in

the campaign.

Genre Emulation. Inspiration is a handy tool for

reinforcing the conventions of a particular genre.

Under this approach, think of the motifs of a genre as

personality traits, flaws , and bonds that can apply to  any

of the adventurers. For example, in a campaign inspired

by film  noir, characters could have an additional flaw:

"I can't resist helping a person I find alluring despite

warnings that he or she is nothing but trouble." If the

characters agree to help a suspicious but seductive

noble and thereby become entangled in a web of intrigue

and betrayal, reward them with inspiration.

Similarly, characters in a horror story typically can't

help but spend a night in a haunted house to learn its

secrets. They probably also go off alone when they

s houldn't. If the party splits up, consid~r giving each

character inspiration.

A sensible person would avoid the noble's intrigues

and the haunted house, but in film  noir or horror,

we're not dealing with sensible people; we're dealing

with protagonists in a particular type of story. For this

approach to work, create a list of your genre's main

conventions and share it with your players. Before the

campaign begins, talk about the list to make sure your

group is on board for embracing those conventions.

Players and Inspiration. Remember that a player

with inspiration can award it to another player. Some

groups even like to treat inspiration as a group resource,

deciding collectively when to spend it on a roll. It's

best to let players award their inspiration as they see

fit,  but feel free to talk to them about following certain

guidelines, particularly if you're trying to reinforce

conventions of a certain genre.

W HEN Do You AwARD  INSPIRATION?

Consider the timing of your inspiration rewards. Some

DMs like to award inspiration in response to an action.

Other DMs like to encourage specific actions by offering

inspiration while a player is considering options. Both

approaches have their strengths and weaknesses.

Waiting until after an action preserves the flow of

play, but it also means players don't know whether their

decisions will earn them inspiration. It also means the

player can't spend the inspiration on the act that earned

it, unless you allow a player to retroactively spend it

or are quick enough to award it before any rolls. This

approach works best for groups that want to focus on

im mersion and player agency, where the DM steps

back and gives the players more freedom to do what

they want.

Telling a player that an action will earn inspiration

provides clarity, but it can make it feel like you are

manipulating the players or making choices for them.

Offering inspiration before an action works great with

groups that are comfortable with an emphasis on genre

emulation and group storytelling, where character

freedom isn't as important as weaving a compelling

tale together.

Start with awarding inspiration after an action ,

especially for your first campaign or when playing with

a new group. That approach is the least disruptive to the

flow of play and avoids making the players feel  as if you

are being manipulative.

TRACKING INSPIRATION

A player typically notes on a character sheet whether

he or she has inspiration, or you can use poker chips or

some other token Alternatively, you can hand out special

d20s to represent inspiration. When a player spends

inspiration, he or she rolls the die and then hands it

back to you. If the player instead gives the inspiration to

someone else, the d20 can go to that other person.

IGNORING INSPIRATION

Inspiration might not work for your campaign. Some

DMs feel  it adds a layer of metagame thinking, and

others feel  that heroism, roleplaying, and other parts

of the game are their own rewards that don't need

incentives like inspiration.

If you choose to ignore inspiration, you're telling the

players that your campaign is one where you let the

dice fall where they may. It's a good option for gritty

campaigns or ones where the DM  focuses on playing an

impartial role as a rules arbiter.

VARIANT :  ONLY PLAYERS AWARD  INSPIRATION

As a DM, you have a lot to track during the game.

Sometimes you can lose track of inspiration and forget

to award it. As a variant rule, you can allow the players

to handle awarding inspiration entirely. During every

session, each player can award inspiration to another

player. A player follows whatever guidelines the group

has agreed on for awarding inspiration.

This approach makes your life easier and also gives

players the chance to recognize each other for good

play. You still need to make sure that inspiration is being

awarded fairly.

This approach works best with groups that are

focused on the story. It falls flat if the players merely

manipulate it to gain advantage in key situations,

without earning inspiration by way of good roleplaying

or whatever other criteria the group has established.

In this variant, you can allow each player to award

inspiration more than once per session. If you do so, the

first time that a player awards inspiration in a session

is free.  Whenever that player awards it later in the same

es  ion. you gain inspiration that you can spend to give

advantage to  any foe of the player characters. There's

no limit to the number of inspirations you can gain in

this way.  and unspent inspiration carries over from one

session to the next.

CHAPTER  8  I RUNNING THE  GAME

RESOLUTION AND  CONSEQUENCES

You determine the consequences of attack rolls, ability

checks, and saving throws. In most cases, doing so is

straightforward. When an attack hits, it deals damage.

When a creature fails a saving throw, the creature

suffers a harmful effect. When an ability check equals or

exceeds the DC, the check succeeds.

As a DM, you have a variety of flourishes and

approaches you can take when adjudicating success and

failure to make things a little less black-and-white.

SuccEss AT A  CosT

Failure can be tough, but the agony is compounded

when a character fails by the barest margin. When a

character fails a roll by only 1 or 2, you can allow the

character to succeed at the cost of a complication or

hindrance. Such complications can run along any of the

following lines:

A character manages to get her sword past a

hobgoblin's defenses and turn a near miss into a hit,

but the hobgoblin twists its shield and disarms her.

A character narrowly escapes the full brunt of a

fireball but ends up prone.

A character fails to intimidate a kobold prisoner, but

the kobold reveals its secrets anyway while shrieking

at the top of its lungs, alerting other nearby monsters.

A character manages to finish an arduous climb to the

top of a cliff despite slipping, only to realize that the

rope on which his companions dangle below him is

close to breaking.

When you introduce costs such as these, try to make

them obstacles and setbacks that change the nature

of the adventuring situation. In exchange for success,

players must consider new ways of facing the challenge.

You can also use this technique when a character

succeeds on a roll by hitting the DC exactly,

complicating marginal success in interesting ways.

DEGREES  OF  FAILURE

Sometimes a failed ability check has different

consequences depending on the degree of failure. For

example, a character who fails to disarm a trapped chest

might accidentally spring the trap if the check fails by

5 or more, whereas a lesser failure means that the trap

wasn't triggered during the botched disarm attempt.

Consider adding similar distinctions to other checks.

Perhaps a failed Charisma (Persuasion) check means a

queen won't help, whereas a failure of 5 or more means

she throws you ir the dungeon for your impudence.

CRITICAL SUCCESS  OR FAILURE

Rolling a  20 or a 1 on an ability check or a saving throw

doesn't normally have any special effect. However,

you can choose to take such an exceptional roll into

account when adjudicating the outcome. It's up to you

to determine how this manifests in the game. An easy

approach is to increase the impact of the success or

failure. For example, rolling a  1 on a failed attempt

to  pick a lock might break the thieves' tools being

used, and rolling a 20 on a successful Intelligence

(Investigation) check might reveal an extra clue.

CHAPTER  8  I RUNNING THE  GAME



EXPLORATION

This section provides guidance for running exploration,

especially travel, tracking, and visibility.

USING A  MAP

Whatever environment the adventurers are exploring,

you can use a map to follow their progress as you relate

the details of their travels. In a dungeon , tracking

movement on a map lets you describe the branching

passages, doors, chambers, and other features the

adventurers encounter as they go,  and gives the players

the opportunity to choose their own path. Similarly, a

wilderness map can show roads, rivers, terrain, and

other features that might guide the characters on their

travels- or lead them astray.

The Map Travel Pace table helps you track travel on

maps of different scales. The table shows how much

distance on a map the adventurers can cover on foot

in  minutes, hours, or days. The table uses the travel

paces- slow, normal, and fast-described in the Player's

Handbook. Characters moving at a normal pace can

walk about 24 miles in a day.

SPECIAL TRAVEL PACE

The rules ori travel pace in the Player's Handbook

assume that a group of travelers adopts a pace that, over

time, is unaffected by the individual members' walking

speeds. The difference between walking speeds can

be significant during combat, but during an overland

journey, the difference vanishes as travelers pause to

catch their breath, the faster ones wait for the slower

ones, and one traveler's quickness is matched by

another traveler's endurance.

A character bestride a phantom steed, soaring

through the air on a carpet of flying,  or riding a sailboar

or a steam-powered gnomish contraption doesn't travel

at a normal rate, since the magic, engine, or wind

doesn't tire the way a creature does and the air doesn't

contain the types of obstructions found on land. When a

creature is traveling with a flying speed or with a speed

granted by magic, an engine, or a natural force (such as

wind or a water current), translate that speed into travel

rates using the following rules:

In 1 minute, you can move a number of feet equal to

your speed times 10.

In 1 hour, you can move a number of miles equal to

your speed divided by 10.

For daily travel, multiply your hourly rate of travel by

the number of hours traveled (typically 8  hours).

For a fast pace, increase the rate of travel by one-third.

For a slow pace, multiply the rate by two-thirds.

For example, a character under the effect of a  wind

walk spell gains a flying speed of 300 feet.  In 1 minute,

the character can move 3,000 feet at a normal pace,

4,000 feet at a fast pace, or 2,000 feet at a slow pace.

The character can also cover 20, 30, or 40 miles in an

hour. The spell lasts for 8 hours, allowing the character

to  travel 160, 240, or 320 miles in a day.

Similarly, a phantom steed spell creates a magical

mount with a speed of 100 feet that doesn't tire like a

real horse. A character on a phantom steed can cover

1,000 feet in 1 minute at a normal pace, 1,333 feet at

a fast pace, or 666 feet at a slow pace. In 1 hour, the

character can travel 7,  10, or 13 miles.

VISIBILITY OUTDOORS

When traveling outdoors, characters can see about 2

miles in any direction on a clear day, or until the point

where trees, hills, or other obstructions block their view.

Rain normally cuts maximum visibility down to  1 mile,

and fog can cut it down to between 100 and 300 feet.

On a clear day,  the characters can see 40 miles if they

are atop a mountain or a tall hill, or are otherwise able

to look down on the area around them from a height.

NOTICING OTHER  CREATURES

While exploring, characters might encounter other

creatures. An important question in such a situation is

who notices whom.

Indoors, whether the sides can see one another

usually depends on the configuration of rooms and

passageways. Vision might also be limited by light

sources. Outdoor visibility can be hampered by terrain,

weather, and time of day.  Creatures can be more likely

to  hear one another before they see anything.

If neither side is being stealthy, creatures

automatically notice each other once they are within

sight or hearing range of one another. Otherwise,

compare the Dexterity (Stealth) check results of the

creatures in the group that is hiding with the passive

Wisdom (Perception) scores of the other group, as

explained in the Player's Handbook.

CHAPTER  8  I RUNNING  THE  GAME

243

TRACKING

Adventurers sometimes choose their path by following

the tracks of other creatures-or other creatures might

track the adventurers! To track, one or more creatures

must succeed on a Wisdom (Survival) check. You  might

require trackers to make a new check in any of the

following circumstances:

They stop tracking and resume after finishing a short

or long rest.

The trail crosses an obstacle, such as a river, that

shows no tracks.

The weather conditions or terrain changes in a way

that makes tracking harder.

The DC for the check depends on how well the ground

shows signs of a creature's passage. No roll is necessary

in situations where the tracks are obvious. For example,

no check is needed to track an army advancing along

a muddy road. Spotting tracks on a bare stone floor is

more challenging, unless the creature being tracked

leaves a distinct trail. Additionally, the passage of time

often makes tracks harder to follow.  In a situation where

there is no trail to follow, you can rule that tracking is

impossible.

The Tracking DCs table offers guidelines for setting

the DC or, if you prefer, you can choose a DC based on

your assessment of the difficulty. You can also grant

advantage on the check if there's more than one set

of tracks to  follow, or disadvantage if the trail being

followed  passes through a well-trafficked area.

On a failed check, the character loses the trail but can

attempt to find it again by making a careful search of the

area. It takes 10 minutes to find a trail in a confined area

such as a dungeon, or 1 hour outdoors.

SOCIAL INTERACTION

During a social interaction , the adventurers usually have

a goal. They want to extract information, secure aid,

win someone's trust, escape punishment, avoid combat,

negotiate a treaty, or achieve whatever other objective

led to the interaction in the first place. The creatures

they interact with also have agendas.

Some DMs prefer to run a social interaction as a

free-form roleplaying exercise, where dice rarely come

into play. Other DMs prefer to resolve the outcome of

an interaction by having characters make Charisma

checks. Either approach works, and most games

fall somewhere in between, balancing player skill

(roleplaying and persuading) with character skill

(reflected by ability checks).

CHAPTER  8  I RUNNING THE  GAME

RESOLVING  INTERACTIONS ------

The Player's Handbook provides guidelines for

balanci ng roleplaying and ability checks in a social

interaction (see chapter 8, "Adventuring," in that book .

This section adds to that material by providing a

structured way to resolve a social interaction. Much of

this structure will be invisible to your players in play aD:

isn't meant to be a substitute for roleplaying.

l.  STARTING ATTITUDE

Choose the starting attitude of a creature the

adventurers are interacting with: friendly,  indifferent.

or hostile.

A friendly creature wants to help the adventurers

and wishes for them to succeed. For tasks or actions

that require no particular risk, effort, or cost, friendly

creatures usually help without question. If an element

personal risk is involved, a successful Charisma check

might be required to convince a friendly creature to take

that risk.

An indifferent creature might help or hinder the

party, depending on what the creature sees as most

beneficial. A creature's indifference doesn't necessarily

make it standoffish or disinterested. Indifferent

creatures might be polite and genial, surly and irritable

or anything in between. A successful Charisma check

is necessary when the adventurers try to  persuade an

indifferent creature to do something.

A hostile creature opposes the adventurers and their

goals but doesn't necessarily attack them on sight.

For example, a condescending noble might wish to

see a group of upstart adventurers fail so as to keep

them from becoming rivals for  the king's attention,

thwarting them with slander and scheming rather than

direct threats and violence. The adventurers need to

succeed on one or more challenging Charisma checks

to  convince a hostile creature to do anything on their

behalf. That said , a hostile creature might be so ill

disposed toward the party that no Charisma check can

improve its attitude, in which case any attempt to sway i

through diplomacy fails automatically.

2.  CONVERSATION

Play out the conversation. Let the adventurers make

their points, trying to frame their statements in

terms that are meaningful to  the creature they are

interacting with.

Changing Attitude. The attitude of a creature

might change over the course of a conversation. If

the adventurers say or do the right things during

an interaction (perhaps by touching on a creature's

ideal, bond, or flaw) , they can make a hostile creature

temporarily indifferent, or make an indifferent creature

temporarily friendly.  Likewise, a gaffe,  insult, or harmful

deed might make a friendly creature temporarily

indifferent or turn an indifferent creature hostile.

Whether the adventurers can shift a creature's

attitude is up to you. You decide whether the adventurer

have successfully couched their statements in terms

that matter to the creature. Typically, a creature's

attitude can't shift more than one step during a single

interaction , whether tempora rily or permanently.

Determining Characteristics. The adventurers don't

Aiding the Check. Other characters who make

necessarily enter into a social interaction with a full

understanding of a creature's ideal. bond , or flaw.  If they

want to shift a creature's attitude by playing on these

characteristics, they first  need to determine what the

creature cares  about. They can guess, but doing so runs

the risk of shifting the creature's attitude in the wrong

direction if they guess badly.

After interacting with a creature long enough to get

a sense of its personality traits and characteristics

through conversation, an adventurer can attempt a

Wisdom (Insight) check to uncover one of the creature's

characteristics. You set the DC. A check that fails by

10 or more might misidentify a characteristic,  so you

should provide a false characteristic or invert one of

the creature's  existing characteristics. For example, if

an old sage's flaw is that he is prejudiced against the

uneducated, an adventurer who badly fails the check

might be told that the sage enjoys personally seeing to

the education of the downtrodden.

Given time,  adventurers can also learn about a

creature's characteristics from other sources , including

its friends and allies, personal letters, and publicly told

stories. Acquiring such information might be the basis

of an entirely different set of social interactions.

3.  CHARISMA  CHECK

When the adventurers get to the point o( their

request, demand, or suggestion- or if you decide the

conversation has run its course- call for a Charisma

check. Any character who has actively participated in

the conversation can make the check. Depending on

how the adventurers handled the conversation , the

Persuasion, Deception , or Intimidation skill might apply

to the check. The creature's  current attitude determines

the DC required to achieve a specific reaction, as shown

in the Conversation Reaction table.

CONVERSATION  REACTION

Friendly Creature's  Reaction

making sacrifices.

sacrifices a re involved.

substantial contributions to the conversation can help

the character making the check. If a helping character

says or does something that would influence the

interaction in a positive way,  the character making

the Charisma check can do so with advantage.  If

the other character inadvertently says something

counterproductive or offensive, the character making

the Charisma check has disadvantage on that check.

Multiple Checks. Certain situations might call for

more than one check, particularly if the adventurers

come into the interaction with multiple goals.

4.  REPEAT?

Once a Charisma check has been made, further

attempts to  influence the target of the interaction might

be fruitless or run the risk of upsetting or angering the

subject creature, potentially shifting its attitude toward

hostility. Use your best judgment. For example, if the

party's rogue says something that pushes a noble's

attitude toward the party from indifferent to  hostile,

another character might be able to diffuse the noble's

hostility with clever roleplaying and a successful

Charisma (Persuasion) check.

RoLEPLAYING

For some DMs, roleplaying comes naturally. If it doesn't

come naturally for you, don't worry. The main thing is

for you to have fun portraying your NPCs and monsters

and to amuse your players in the process. You  don't

need to  be a practiced thespian or comedian to  create

drama or humor. The key is to pay attention to  the story

elements and characterizations that make your players

laugh or feel  emotionally engaged and to incorporate

those things into your roleplaying.

BEING THE NPC

Imagine how a character or monster you bring to life

would react to the adventurers. Consider what it cares

about. Does it have any ideals, flaws , or bonds? By

working such things into your portrayal, you not only

make the character or monster more believable, but you

also enhance the sense that the adventurers are in a

living world.

Strive for responses and actions that introduce twists

into the game. For example, an old woman whose family

was killed at the hands of an evil wizard might regard

the party's wizard with grave suspicion.

However you roleplay a character or monster, the

classic advice for writers holds true: show, don't tell. For

example, rather than describe an NPC as shallow and

self-centered, have the individual act the way you would

expect a shallow, self-centered person to behave. The

NPC might have off-the-cuff answers for everything,

an over-willingness to share personal anecdotes, and a

desperate need to make himself or herself the subject of

every conversation.

USING YOUR VOICE

Most of what you say during a session will be at a

consistent level.  For dramatic effect, be ready to shout

out a battle cry or speak in a conspiratorial whisper.

CHAPTER  8  /  RUNNING THE  GAME

245

Also, characters and monsters with distinctive voices

are memorable. If you're not a natural mimic or actor,

borrowing distinctive speech patterns from real life, the

movies, or television is a good place to start. Practice

different voices and impersonations of famous people,

then use those voices to bring your NPCs to life.

Experiment with different speech patterns. For

instance, a barmaid and a city magistrate probably use

their words differently. Similarly, peasants could speak

in earthy dialects, while rich folk talk in haughty drawls.

Let a pirate NPC say, "Arrrr, maties!" in your best Long

John Silver voice. Let intelligent monsters unfamiliar

with Common stumble along with awkward grammar.

Let drunkards and monsters mutter with slurred

speech, while lizardfolk hiss their threats.

In any interaction with multiple NPCs, make sure

the adventurers remain the focus. Have the NPCs talk

to them, not so much to each other. If possible, let one

NPC do most of the talking, but if multiple NPCs need

to  talk, give them distinct voices so the players know

who's who.

UsiNG YouR FAcE AND ARMS

Use your facial expressions to help show a character's

emotions. Scowl, smile, grin, snarl, pout, cross your

eyes-do whatever it takes to make the character or

monster memorable to the players. When you combine

facial expressions with an unusual voice, a character

truly comes to life.

Though you don't need to stand up out of your chair,

you can use your arms to bring even more life to an

NPC. A noble could chop the air with one hand while

speaking in a deadpan monotone, while an archmage

might express her displeasure by silently rolling her

eyes and massaging her temples with her fingers .

ENGAGING THE  PLAYERS

Some players enjoy roleplaying and interaction more

than others. Whatever your players' tastes, your

lively portrayal of NPCs and monsters can inspire

players to make just as much investment in portraying

their characters. This makes social interactions an

opportunity for everyone to become more immersed

in the game, creating a story whose protagonists

have depth.

To make sure everyone has something to do during a

roleplaying-heavy game session, consider one or more of

the following approaches.

Appeal to Player Preferences. There are in-game

activities that players enjoy more than others, as

discussed in this book's  introduction. Players who like

acting thrive in interaction situations, and it's fine to let

those players take the spotlight. They often inspire other

players by their example, but make sure those other

players have an opportunity to join in the fun.

Players who like exploring and storytelling are

usually amenable to roleplaying, as long as it moves the

campaign forward and reveals more about the world.

Players who like problem-solving often enjoy figuring

out the right thing to say to shift an NPC's attitude.

Players who are instigators like provoking reactions

from NPCs, so they're often easily engaged-though not

always productively.

CHAPTER  8  I RUNNING  THE  GAME

P layers who like to optimize their characters and

slay monsters also like to argue, and having conflict

within an interaction can help those players embrace

roleplaying. Still, creating combat connections to an

extended interaction (such as a corrupt vizier sending

assassins to kill the adventurers) is often the best way r

keep action-focused players engaged.

Target Specific Characters.  Create situations where

characters who might not otherwise be engaged with a

social interaction have to  do at least some of the talk in

Perhaps the NPC in question is a family member or

a contact of a particular adventurer and talks only to

that character. An NPC of a certain race or class mighr

listen only to characters he or she feels a kinship with.

Creating a sense of importance can be a great way to ge

specific players engaged, but don't shut out players who

are already roleplaying.

If a couple of players are dominating the conversation

take a moment now and then to involve the others. You

can do this in character if you like: "And what about you;

hulking friend? Speak, barbarian! What will you pledge

in exchange for my favor? " Or just ask the player what

his or her character is doing while the conversation is

going on. The first approach is better for players who are

already comfortable speaking in their characters' voices

The second approach works better for  players who neeri

encouragement to engage in a roleplaying scenario.

OBJECTS

When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a

window, or smash a vampire's coffin, the only hard and

fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools,

characters can destroy any destructible object. Use

common sense when determining a character's succe

at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a

section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is

likely to break before the wall does.

For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete.

inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book,

table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is

composed of many other objects.

STATISTICS  FOR OBJECTS

When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class

and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give

it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to  specific

types of damage.

Armor Class. An object's Armor Class is a measure

of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when

striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging

out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides

suggested AC values for various substances.

and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.

Huge and Gargantuan Objects. Normal weapons are

of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects,

such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or

massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge

tapestry, and an earthquake spell can reduce a colossus

to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object's

hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long

the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is

acting against it. If you track hit points for the object,

divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each

section's hit points separately. Destroying one of those

sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a

Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when

one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.

Objects and Damage Types. Objects are immune

to poison and psychic damage. You might decide

that some damage types are more effective against a

particular object or substance than others. For example,

bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things

but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or

cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire  and lightning

damage. A pick can chip away stone but can't effectively

cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.

Damage Threshold. Big objects such as castle walls

often have extra resilience represented by a damage

th reshold. An object with a damage threshold has

immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount

of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or

greater than its damage threshold, in which case it

ta kes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet

or exceed the object's damage threshold is considered

superficial and doesn't reduce the object's hit points.

COMBAT

This section builds on the combat rules in the Player's

Handbook and offers tips for keeping the game running

smoothly when a fight breaks out.

TRACKING INITIATIVE

You can use several different methods for keeping track

of who goes when in combat.

HIDDEN  LIST

Many DMs keep track of initiative on a list the players

can't see: usually a piece of paper behind a DM screen

or a spreadsheet on a tablet computer. This method

allows you to keep track of combatants who haven't been

revealed yet, and you can use the initiative list as a place

to  reco rd the current hit points of monsters, as well as

other useful notes.

A downside of this approach is that you have to remind

the players round after round when their turns come up.

VISIBLE  LIST

You  can use a whiteboard to track initiative. As the

players tell you their initiative numbers, write them on

the whiteboard in order from highest to lowest, leaving

space between each name. Either write the monsters'

initiatives on the list at the same time or add them to  the

list on each monster's first turn.

As a further improvement, use magnets that you can

attach to  a metal-based whiteboard with characters' and

monsters' names written on them, or write those names

on cards held in place by magnets.

A visible list lets everyone see the order of play.

Players know when their turns are coming up, and they

can start planning their actions in advance. A visible list

also removes any uncertainty about when the monsters

will act in the fight.

A variation on the visible list is to give one player

responsibility for keeping track of initiative, either on

a white board or on a piece of paper the other players

can see. This method reduces the number of things you

need to keep track of yourself.

INDEX  CARDS

In this approach, each character gets an index card, as

does each group of identical monsters. When the players

tell you their initiative numbers, write the numbers on

their characters' index cards. Do the same when you roll

the monsters' initiative. Then arrange the cards in order

from highest to lowest. Starting at the top, you move

down through the stack. When you call out the name of

the character whose turn it is, also mention who's next,

prompting that player to start thinking ahead. After

each character or group of monsters acts, the top card is

moved to the bottom of the stack.

At first,  players don't know the order of play when

you use combat cards, and they don't know where the

monsters fall  into the order until the monsters act.

TRACKING MONSTER HIT POINTS

During a combat encounter, you need to track how much

damage each monster takes. Most DMs track damage

in secret so that their players don't know how many hit

points a monster has remaining. Whether you choose to

be secretive or not is up to you. What's important is that

every monster's hit points be tracked individually.

Tracking damage for  one or two monsters isn't

onerous , but it helps to  have a system for  larger

groups of monsters. If you aren't using miniatures

or other visual aids, the easiest way to keep track

of your monsters is to assign them unique features.

Descriptions such as "the ogre with the nasty scar"

and "the ogre with the horned helm" help you and your

players track which monster is which. For example,

imagine that you're running an encounter with three

CHAPTER 8  I RUNNING THE  GAME

247

ogres, each of which has 59 hit points. Once initiative

is rolled, jot down each ogre's hit points and add notes

(and even a name, if you like) to differentiate each one:

Krag  (ogre wf  scar):  59

Thod  (ogre wf  helm):  59

Mur  (ogre who smells  like  poo):  59

If you use miniatures to represent monsters, one

easy way to differentiate them is to give each one a

unique miniature. If you use identical miniatures to

represent multiple monsters, you can tag the miniatures

with small stickers of different colors or stickers with

different letters or numbers on them.

For example, in a combat encounter with three ogres,

you could use three identical ogre miniatures tagged

with stickers marked A, B,  and C,  respectively. To track

the ogres' hit points, you can sort them by letter, then

subtract damage from their hit points as they take it.

Your records might look something like this after a few

rounds of combat:

Ogre A:  59~ 45 ~ t4 9 dead

Ogre  B:  59 5t 30

Ogre C:  59

Players often ask how hurt a monster looks. Don't ever

feel as though you need to  reveal exact hit points, but if

a monster is below half its hit point maximum, it's fair to

say that it has visible wounds and appears beaten down.

You  can describe a monster taken to  half its hit points as

bloodied, giving the players a sense of progress in a fight

against a tough opponent, and helping them judge when

to use their most powerful spells and abilities.

USING AND  TRACKING  CONDITIONS

Various rules and features in the game are clear abour

when they apply a condition to a creature. You  can also

apply conditions on the fly.  They're meant to be intuitiYe

for you  to  do so. For example, if a character is in a state

such as sleep, that lacks consciousness, you can say

the character is unconscious. Or did a character just

stumble onto the ground? He or she is now prone.

Keeping track of conditions can become tricky.

For monsters, it's often easiest to  track conditions on

combat cards or wherever you track initiative. Players

should remember any conditions affecting their

characters. Because players have incentive to forget or

overlook hampering conditions, character conditions

can also be marked on combat cards or a whiteboard.

You  might also try keeping a supply of index cards on

hand, marked with conditions and their effects. Then

hand the cards to players as the conditions come up.

Having a bright pink index card on top of a character

sheet can help even the most absentminded player

remember the effects of being charmed or frightened.

MONSTERS AND  CRITICAL HITS

A monster follows the same rule for critical hits as

a player, character. That said, if you use a monster's

average damage, rather than rolling, you might wonder

how to handle a critical hit. When the monster scores

a critical hit, roll all the damage dice associated with

the hit and add them to the average damage. For

example, if a goblin normally deals 5 (ld6 + 2) slashing

damage on a hit and scores a critical hit, it deals 5 + l d6

slashing damage.

IMPROVISING  DAMAGE

A monster or effect typically specifies the amount of

determine damage on the fly.  The Improvising Damage

table gives you suggestions for when you do so.

T he Damage Severity and Level table is a guide to

how deadly these damage numbers are for characters

of various levels. Cross-reference a character's level

with the damage being dealt to gauge the severity of

the damage.

In contrast, dangerous damage values pose a

significant threat to weaker characters and could

potentially kill a character of the level shown if that

character is missing many hit points.

As the name suggests, deadly damage is enough

to drop a character of the level shown to  0 hit points.

This level of damage can kill even powerful characters

outright if they are already wounded.

ADJUDICATING AREAS  OF  EFFECT

Many spells and other game feat ures create areas of

effect, such as the cone and the sphere. If you're not

using miniatures or another visual aid, it can sometimes

be difficult to determine who's in an area of effect and

who isn't. The easiest way to address such uncertainty

is to go with your gut and make a call.

If you would like more guidance, consider using

the Targets in Areas of Effect table. To  use the table,

imagine which combatants are near one another, and

let the table guide you in determining the number of

those combatants that are caught in an area of effect.

Add or subtract targets based on how bunched up the

potential targets are. Consider rolling 1d3 to determine

the amo unt to add or subtract.

Length-;- 30  (round  up)

Radiu s-;- 5 (round  up)

Damage sufficient to cause a setback rarely poses

a risk of death to characters of the level shown, but

a severely weakened character might be laid low by

this damage.

For example, if a wizard directs burning hands (a

15-foot cone) at a nearby group of orcs, you could use

the table and say that two orcs are targeted (15 + 10

= 1.5, rounded up to 2). Similarly, a sorcerer could

CHAPTER  8  I RUNN lNG THE  GAME

249

launch a lightning bolt (100-foot line) at some ogres

and hobgoblins, and you could use the table to say

four of the monsters are targeted (100 + 30 =  3.33,

rounded up to  4).

This approach aims at simplicity instead of spatial

precision. If you prefer more tactical nuance, consider

using miniatures.

HANDLING MOBS

Keeping combat moving along at a brisk pace can be

difficult when there are dozens of monsters involved

in a battle. When handling a crowded battlefield, you

can speed up play by forgoing attack rolls in favor of

approximating the average number of hits a large group

of monsters can inflict on a target.

Instead of rolling an attack roll, determine the

minimum d20 roll a creature needs in order to hit a

target by subtracting its attack bonus from the target's

AC. You'll need to refer to the result throughout the

battle, so it's best to write it down.

Look up the minimum d20 roll needed on the Mob

Attacks table. The table shows you how many creatures

that need that die roll or higher must attack a target

in order for one of them to hit. If that many creatures

attack the target, their combined efforts result in one of

them hitting the target.

For example, eight orcs surround a fighter.  The orcs'

attack bonus is +5 , and the fighter's AC is 19. The orcs

need a  14 or higher to  hit the fighter. According to the

table, for every three orcs that attack the fighter,  one

of them hits. There are enough orcs for two groups of

three. The remaining two orcs fail  to hit the fighter.

If the attacking creatures deal different amounts

of damage, assume that the creature that deals the

most damage is the one that hits. If the creature that

hits has multiple attacks with the same attack bonus,

assume that it hits once with each of those attacks. If a

creature's attacks have different attack bonuses , resolve

each attack separately.

This attack resolution system ignores critical hits in

favor of reducing the number of die rolls. As the number

of combatants dwindles, switch back to using individual

die rolls to avoid situations where one side can't possibly

hit the other.

USING MINIATURES

In combat, players can often rely on your description

to visualize where their characters are in relation to

their surroundings and their enemies. Some complex

battles, however, are easier to  run with visual aids, the

most common of which are miniatures and a grid. If y

like to construct model terrain, build three-dimension

dungeons, or draw maps on large vinyl mats, you sho  -

also consider using miniatures.

The Player's Handbook offers simple rules for

depicting combat using miniature figures on a grid. T'- -

section expands on that material.

TACTICAL MAPS

You can draw tactical maps with colored markers on a

wet-erase vinyl mat with  l-inch squares, on a large sh  -

of paper, or on a similar flat surface. Preprinted poster

sized maps, maps assembled from cardboard tiles, anc.

terrain made of sculpted plaster or resin are also fu n.

The most common unit for tactical maps is the 5-foo::

square, and maps with grids are readily available and

easy to create. However, you don't have to use a grid a

all. You  can track distances with a  tape measure, string

craft sticks, or pipe cleaners cut to specific lengths.

Another option is a play surface covered by  l-inch

hexagons (often called hexes), which combines the eas_

counting of a grid with the more flexible movement of

using no grid. Dungeon corridors with straight walls

and right angles don't map easily onto hexes, though.

CHAPTER 8  I RUNN I NG THE  GAME

CREATURE  SIZE  ON  SQUARES A  D  HEXES

A creature's size determines how much space it

occupies on squares or hexes, as shown in the Creature

Size and Space table. If the mi niature you use for a

monster takes up an amount of space different from

what's on the table, that's fine, but treat the monster

as  its official size for all other rules. For example,

you might use a miniature that has  a Large base to

represent a Huge giant. That giant takes up less space

on the battlefield than its size suggests, but it is still

Huge for the purposes of rules like grappling.

A REAS  OF EFFECT

T he area of effect of a spell, monster ability,  or other

feature must be translated onto squares or hexes to

determine which potential targets are in  the area and

which aren't.

Choose an intersection of squares or hexes as the

point of origin of an area of effect, then follow its rules

as normal. If an area of effect is circular and covers at

least half a square, it affects that square.

L INE  OF  SIGHT

To  precisely determine whether there is line of sight

between two spaces, pick a corner of one space and

rrace an imaginary line from that corner to any part

of another space. If at least one such line doesn't pass

th rough or touch an object or effect that blocks vision

such as a stone wall, a thick curtain, or a dense cloud of

fog-then there is line of sight.

C OVER

To determine whether a target has cover against an

at tack or other effect on a grid, choose a corner of the

anacker's space or the point of origin of an area of effect.

Then trace imaginary lines from that corner to every

corner of any one square the target occupies. If one or

two of those lines are blocked by an obstacle (including

another creature), the target has half cover. If three or

four of those lines are blocked but the attack can still

reach the target (such as when the target is behind an

arrow slit), the target has three-quarters cover.

On hexes, use the same procedure as a grid, drawing

lines between the corners of the hexagons. The target

has half cover if up to three lines are blocked by an

obstacle, and three-quarters cover if four or more lines

a re blocked but the attack can still reach the target.

OPTIONAL RULE :  FLANKING

If you regularly use miniatures, flanking gives

combatants a simple way to gain advantage on attack

rolls against a common enemy.

A creature can't flank an enemy that it can't see. A

creature also can't flank while it is incapacitated. A

Large or larger creature is flanking as long as at least

one square or hex of its space qualifies for flanking.

Flanking on Squares. When a creature and at

least one of its allies are adjacent to  an enemy and on

opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, they

flank that enemy, and each of them has advantage on

melee attack rolls against that enemy.

When in doubt about whether two creatures flank

an enemy on a grid, trace an imaginary line between

the centers of the creatures' spaces. If the line passes

through opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space,

the enemy is flanked.

Flanking on Hexes. When a creature and at least one

of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite

sides of the enemy's space, they flank that enemy, and

each of them has advantage on attack rolls against

that enemy. On hexes, count around the enemy from

one creature to its ally. Against a Medium or smaller

creature, the allies flank if there are 2 hexes between

them. Against a Large creature, the allies flank if there

are 4 hexes between them. Against a Huge creature,

they must have 5 hexes between them. Against a

Gargantuan creature, they must have at least 6 hexes

between them.

CHAPTER  8  I  RUNNlNG THE  GAME

OPTIONAL RULE:  DIAGONALS

The Player's Handbook presents a simple method for

counting movement and measuring range on a grid:

count every square as 5 feet, even if you're moving

diagonally. Though this is fast in play, it breaks the laws

of geometry and is inaccurate over long distances. This

optional rule provides more realism, but it  requires

more effort during combat.

When measuring range or moving diagonally on a

grid, the first diagonal square counts as 5 feet,  but the

second diagonal square counts as 10 feet. This pattern

of 5 feet and then 10 feet continues whenever you're

counting diagonally, even if you move horizontally or

vertically between different bits of diagonal movement.

For example, a character might move one square

diagonally (5  feet),  then three squares straight (15 feet),

and then another square diagonally (10 feet) for a total

movement of 30 feet.

OPTIONAL RuLE :  FACING

If you want the precision of knowing which way a

creature is facing , consider using this optional rule.

Whenever a creature ends its move, it can change its

facing.  Each creature has a front arc (the direction it

faces),  left and right side arcs, and a rear arc. A creature

can also change its facing as a  reaction when any other

creature moves.

A creature can normally target only creatures in its

front or side arcs. It can't see into its rear arc. This

means an attacker in the creature's rear arc makes

attack rolls against it with advantage.

Shields apply their bonus to AC  only against attacks

from the front arc or the same side arc as the shield. For

example, a fighter with a shield on the left arm can use it

only against attacks from  the front and left arcs.

Feel free to  determine that not all creatures have

every type of arc. For example, an amorphous ochre

jelly could treat all of its arcs as front ones, while a

hydra might have three front arcs and one rear one.

On squares, you pick one side of a creature's space

as the direction it is facing.  Draw a diagonal line

outward from each corner of this side to determine the

squares in its front arc. The opposite side of the space

determines its rear arc in  the same way.  The remaining

spaces to  either side of the creature form its side arcs.

On hexes, determining the front, rear, and side arcs

requires more judgment. Pick one side of the creature's

space and create a wedge shape expanding out from

there for the front arc, and another on the opposite side

of the creature for the rear arc. The remaining spaces to

either side of the creature are its side arcs.

A square or hex might be in more than one arc,

depending on how you draw the lines from a creature's

space. If more than half of a square or hex lies in one

arc, it is in that arc. If it is split exactly down the middle,

use this rule: if half of it lies in the front arc, it's in that

arc. If half of it is in a side arc and the rear arc, it's in

the side arc.

CHAPTER  8  \  RUNNING THE  GAME

ADJUDICATING REACTION TIMING

Typical combatants rely on the opportunity attack

and the Ready action for  most of their reactions in a

fight.  Various spells and features give a creature more

reaction options, and sometimes the timing of a reacti  -

can be difficult to adjudicate. Use this rule of thumb:

follow whatever timing is specified in the reaction's

description. For example, the opportunity attack and

the shield spell are clear about the fact that they can

interrupt their triggers. If a reaction has no timing

specified, or the timing is unclear, the reaction occurs

after its trigger finishes , as in the Ready action.

CHASES

Strict application of the movement rules can turn a

potentially exciting chase into a dull, predictable affair.

Faster creatures always catch up to slower ones, while

creatures with the same speed never close the distance

between each other. This set of rules can make chase

more exciting by introducing random elements.

BEGINNING A  CHASE

A chase requires a quarry and at least one pursuer. Any

participants not already in initiative order must roll

initiative. As in combat, each participant in the chase

can take one action and move on its turn. The chase

ends when one side drops out or the quarry escapes.

When a chase begins, determine the starting

distance between the quarry and the pursuers. Track

the distance between them, and designate the pursuer

closest to the quarry as the lead. The lead pursuer migh

change from round to round.

RUNNING THE  CHASE

Participants in the chase are strongly motivated to  use

the Dash action every round. Pursuers who stop to casr

spells and make attacks run the risk of losing their

quarry, and a quarry that does so is likely to be caught.

DASHING

During the chase, a participant can freely use the Dash

action a number of times equal to 3 + its Constitution

modifier. Each additional Dash action it takes during

the chase requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10

Constitution check at the end of its turn or gain one !eve.

of exhaustion.

A participant drops out of the chase if its exhaustion

reaches level  5, since its speed becomes 0. A creature

can remove the levels of exhaustion it gained during the

chase by finishing a short or long rest.

SPELLS AND ATTACKS

A chase participant can make attacks and cast spells

against other creatures within range. Apply the

normal rules for cover, terrain, and so on to the attacks

and spells.

Chase participants can't normally make opportunity

attacks against each other, since they are all assumed

to be moving in the same direction at the same time.

However, participants can  till be -  e rarge  of

opportunity attacks from creatw .:  o  participating

in the chase. For example. ad,en  -e

ho chase a

thief past a gang of thugs in an alley might provoke

opportunity attacks fro m  the thug  .

ENDING A  CHASE

A chase ends when one s ide or the other  tops, when  the

quarry escapes, or when the pursuer  are close enough

to  their quarry to  catch it.

If neither side gives up the cha  e. the quarry ma kes a

Dexterity (Stealth) check at the end of each rou nd, after

every participant in the chase ha  taken its tu rn. The

result is compared to the passive\  isdom (Perception)

scores of the pursuers. If the quarry consists of multiple

creatures, they all make the check.

If the quarry is never out of the lead pursuer's sight,

the check fails automatically.  Otherwise, if the result of

the quarry's check is greater tha n the highest passive

score, that quarry escapes. If not, the chase continues

for  another round.

The quarry gains advantage or disadvantage on its

check based on prevailing circumstances , as shown in

the Escape Factors table. If one or more factors give the

quarry both advantage and disadvantage on its check,

the quarry has neither, as usual.

EscAPE  FACTORS

Other factors might help or hinder the quarry's ability

to escape, at your discretion. For example, a quarry with

a faerie fire spell cast on it might have disadvantage on

checks made to escape because it's  much easier to spot.

Escape doesn't necessarily mean the quarry has

outpaced its pursuers. For example, in an urban

setting, escape might mean the quarry ducked into a

crowd or slipped around a corner, leaving no clue as to

where it went.

CHASE  COMPLICATIONS

As with any good chase scene, complications can arise

to  make a chase more pulse-pounding. The Urban

Chase Complications table and the Wilderness Chase

Complications table provide several examples.

Complications occur randomly. Each participant in

the chase rolls a d20 at the end of its turn. Consult the

appropriate table to determine whether a complication

occurs. If it does, it affects the next chase participant in

the initiative order, not the participant who rolled the

die. The participant who rolled the die or the participant

affected by the complication can spend inspiration to

negate the complication.

CHAPTER  8  I RUNNING THE  GAME

Characters can create their own complications to

DESIGNING YouR OwN  CHASE TABLES

The tables presented here don't work for all possible

environments. A chase through the sewers of

Baldur's Gate or through the spiderweb-filled alleys

of Menzoberranzan might inspire you to create your

own table.

SPLITTING UP

Creatures being chased can split up into smaller groups.

This tactic forces pursuers to either divide their forces

or allow some of the quarry to escape. If a pursuit

splits into several smaller chases, resolve each chase

separately. Run a round of one chase, then a ro und of

the next, and so on, tracking the distances for each

separate group.

MAPPING THE  CHASE

If you have the opportunity to  plan out a chase, take

the time to draw a rough map that shows the route.

Insert obstacles at specific points, especia lly ones that

require the characters to make ability checks or saving

throws to avoid slowing or stopping, or use a random

table of complications similar to the ones in this section.

Otherwise, improvise as you play.

Complications can be barriers to progress or

opportunities for  mayhem. Characters being chased

through a forest by bugbears might spot a wasp nest

and slow down long enough to attack the nest or throw

rocks at it, thus creating an obstacle for their pursuers.

A map of a chase can be linear or have many

branches, depending on the nature of the chase. For

example, a mine cart chase might have few (if any)

branches, while a sewer chase might have several.

ROLE  REVERSAL

During a chase, it's possible for the pursuers to become

the quarry. For example, characters chasing a thief

through a ma rketplace might draw unwanted attention

from other members of the thieves' guild. As they

pursue the fleeing thief, they must also evade the thieves

pursuing them. Roll initiative for the new arrivals, and

run both chases simultaneously. In another scenario,

the fleeing thief might run into the waiting arms of his

accomplices. The outnumbered characters might decide

to  flee with the thieves in pursuit.

SIEGE  EQUIPMENT

Siege weapons are designed to assail castles and other

wa lled fortifications. They see much use in campaigns

that feature war. Most siege weapons don't move around

a battlefield on their own; they require creatures to move

them , as well as to  load, aim, and fire them.

BALLISTA

Large object

Armor Class: 15

Hit Points: 50

Damage Immunities: poison, psychic

A ballista is a massive crossbow that fires heavy bolts.

tipped easily, spilling its contents. Once emptied, a

cauldron must be refilled-and its contents must usually

be reheated- before it can be used again. It takes three

actions to fill  a cauldron and one action to tip it.

Cauldrons can be filled with other liquids, such as

acid or green slime, with different effects.

Boiling Oil. The cauldron pours boiling oil onto a

10-foot-square area directly below it. Any creature in the

area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking

10 (3d6) fire  damage on a failed save, or half as much

damage on a successful one.

MANGONEL

Large object

Armor Class: 15

Hit Points: 100

Damage Immunities: poison , psychic

A mangonel is a type of catapult that hurls heavy

proj ectiles  in a high arc. This payload can hit targets

behind cover. Before the mangonel can be fired, it must

be loaded and aimed. It takes two actions to load the

weapon, two actions to aim it, and one action to fire it.

A mangonel typically hurls a heavy stone, although it

can hurl other kinds of projectiles, with different effects.

Mangone} Stone. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit,

DISEASES

A plague ravages the kingdom , setting the adventurers

on a quest to find a cure. An adventurer emerges from

an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon

finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock

offends some dark power and contracts a strange

affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.

A simple outbreak might amount to little more than

a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting

of lesser restoration. A more complicated outbreak can

form the basis of one or more adventures as characters

search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and

deal with the consequences.

A disease that does more than infect a few party

members is primarily a plot device. The rules help

describe the effects of the disease and how it can be

cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren't

bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect

any creature, and a given illness might or might not

pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A

plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep

through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races

untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell.

SAMPLE  DISEASES

The diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease

can work in the game. Feel free to  alter the saving

throw DCs, incubation ti mes, symptoms, and other

characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign.

~ACKLE FEVER

:-his disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are

:;rrangely immune. While in the grips of this disease,

ctims frequently succumb to fits  of mad laughter,

givi ng the disease its common name and  its morbid

::Uckname: "the shrieks."

Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and

mclude fever and disorientation. The infected creature

gains one level of exhaustion that can't be removed until

Lhe disease is cured.

Any event that causes the infected creature great

rress- including entering combat, taking damage,

experiencing fear, or having a nightmare- forces the

creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.

Dn a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic

da mage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter

or 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw

ar the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter

and the incapacitated condition on a success.

Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10

ieet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter

must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or

also become infected with the disease. Once a creature

ucceeds on this save, it  is immune to the mad laughter

of that particular infected creature for  24 hours.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature

can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a

uccessful  save, the DC for  this save and for the save to

avoid  an attack of mad laughter drops by  1d6. When the

aving throw DC drops to  0,  the creature recovers from

rhe disease. A creature that fails three of these saving

rh rows gains a randomly determined form of indefinite

madness, as described later in this chapter.

S EWER PLAGUE

Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category

of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps,

and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes

tra nsmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such

as rats and otyughs.

When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that

carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with

fi lth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature

must succeed on a DC  11  Constitution saving throw or

become infected.

It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to

manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include

fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one

level of exhaustion , and it regains only half the normal

number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit

points from finishing a long rest.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature

must make a DC 11  Constitution saving throw. On a

fa iled save, the character gains one level of exhaustion.

On a successful save, the character's ex haustion level

decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw

reduces the infected creature's level of exhaustion below

1, the creature recovers from  the disease.

SIGHT RoT

This painful infection causes bleed ing from the eyes and

eventually blinds the victim.

A beast or humanoid  that drinks water tainted by

sight rot must succeed on a DC 15  Constitution saving

throw or become infected. One day after infection, the

creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature

takes a - 1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks

that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the

symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When

it reaches - 5,  the victim is blinded until its sight is

restored by magic such as Jesser restoration or heal.

Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called

Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour,

a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit

can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied

to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents

the disease from worsening after that rest. After three

doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.

PorsoNs

Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are

illegal in  most societies but are a favorite tool among

assassins, draw, and other evil  creatures.

Poisons come in the following four types.

Contact. A creature that touches contact poison with

exposed skin suffers its effects.

Ingested. A creature must swallow an entire dose of

ingested poison to suffer its effects. You might decide

that a partial dose has a  reduced effect, such as allowing

advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half

damage on a failed save.

Inhaled. These poisons are powders or gases that

take effect when they are inhaled. A single dose fills  a

5-foot cube.

Injury. A creature that takes slashing or piercing

damage from a weapon or piece of ammunition coated

with injury poison is exposed to its effects.

to this poison must make a DC 10 Constitution saving

throw. On a failed save, it takes 6 (1d12) poison damage

CHAPTER  8  I RUNNING  THE  GAME

257

and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, the

creature takes half damage and isn't poisoned.

Burnt Othur Fumes (Inhaled). A creature subjected

to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution

saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage, and must

repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns.

(1d6) poison damage. After three successful saves, the

poison ends.

Carrion Crawler Mucus (Contact). This poison

must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated

carrion crawler. A creature subjected to this poison

must succeed on a DC  13 Constitution saving throw

or be poisoned for  1 minute. The poisoned creature is

paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at

the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on

a success.

Drow Poison (Injury). This poison is typically made

only by the draw, and only in a place far removed from

sunlight. A creature subjected to  this poison must

succeed on a DC  13 Constitution saving throw or be

poisoned for  1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or

more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned

in this way.  The creature wakes up if it  takes damage or

if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

Essence of Ether (Inhaled). A creature subjected

to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution

saving throw or become poisoned for 8 hours. The

poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes

up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an

action to shake it awake.

Malice (Inhaled). A creature subjected to  this poison

must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw

or become poisoned for  1 hour. The poisoned creature

is blinded.

Midnight Tears (Ingested). A creature that ingests

this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight.

If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the

creature must succeed on a DC 17  Constitution saving

throw, taking 31  (9d6) poison damage on a failed save,

or half as much damage on a successful one.

Oil ofTaggit (Contact). A creature subjected to this

poison must succeed on a DC  13 Constitution saving

throw or become poisoned for 24 hours. The poisoned

creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it

takes damage.

Pale Tincture (Ingested). A creature subjected to this

poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving

throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage and become

poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving

throw every 24 hours, taking 3 (1d6) poison damag<:

on a failed save. Until this poison ends, the damage

the poison deals can't be healed by any means. After

seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the

creature can heal normally.

Purple Worm Poison (Injury). This poison must be

harvested from a dead or incapacitated purple worm.

A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC

19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison

damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a

successful one.

CHAPTER  8  I RUNNING THE  GAME

Serpent Venom (Injury). This poison must be

harvested from a dead or incapacitated giant poisonou

snake. A creature subjected to  this poison must succeed

on a DC  11  Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6)

poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage

on a successful one.

Torpor (Ingested). A creature subjected to this poison

must succeed on a DC  15  Constitution saving throw or

become poisoned for 4d6 hours. The poisoned creature

is incapacitated.

Truth Serum (Ingested). A creature subjected to thi

Wyvern Poison (Injury). This poison must be

harvested from a dead or incapacitated wyvern. A

creature subjected to this poison must make a DC

15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison

damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a

successful one.

PURCHASING POISON

In some settings, strict laws prohibit the possession

and use of poison, but a black-market dealer or

unscrupulous apothecary might keep a hidden stash.

Characters with criminal contacts might be able to

acquire poison relatively easily. Other characters might

have to make extensive inquiries and pay bribes before

they track down the poison they seek.

The Poisons table gives suggested prices for single

doses of various poisons.

CRAFTING AND  HARVESTING POISO  -

During downtime between adventures, a character

can use the crafting rules in  the Player's Handbook to

create basic poison if the character has proficiency with

a poisoner's kit At your discretion, the character can

craft other kinds of poison. Not all poison ingredients

are available for purchase, and tracking down certain

ingredients might form the basis of an entire adventure.

A character can instead attempt to harvest poison

from a poisonous creature, such as a snake, wyvern, or

carrion crawler. The creature must be incapacitated or

dead, and the harvesting requires 1d6 minutes followed

by a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check. (Proficiency

with the poisoner's kit applies to this check if the

character doesn't have proficiency in Nature.) On a

successful check, the character harvests enough poison

for a single dose. On a failed check, the character is

unable to extract any poison. If the character fails the

check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the

creature's poison.

MADNESS

In a typical campaign, characters aren't driven mad

by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict

day after day,  but sometimes the stress of being an

adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign

has a strong horror theme, you might want to use

madness as a way to  reinforce that theme, emphasizing

the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the

adventurers face.

GOING MAD

Various magical effects can inflict madness on an

otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as contact

other plane a nd symbol, can cause insanity, a nd you can

use the madness rules here instead of the s pell  effects

in the Player 's Handbook. Diseases, poisons, and planar

effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of

Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts

can a lso break the psyche of a character who uses or

becomes attuned to them.

Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires

a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. If your game

includes the Sanity score (see chapter 9,  "Dungeon

Master's Workshop"),  a creature makes a Sanity saving

throw instead.

MADNESS  EFFECTS - - - - -

Madness can be short-term, long-term , or indefinite.

Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term

madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More

horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in  long

term or indefin ite madness.

A cha racter a ffl icted with short-term madness is

subjected to a n effect from the Short-Term Madness

table for  ldlO minutes.

A charac ter a fflicted with long-term madness is

subjected to  an effect from the Long-Term Madness

table for  ldlO x 10 hours.

A character afflicted with indefinite madness gains

a new character fl aw from  the Indefinite Madness table

that lasts until cured.

them-they divide the total XP value of the monsters

evenly among themselves. If the party received

substantial assistance from one or more NPCs, count

those NPCs as party members when dividing up the

XP.  (Because the NPCs made the fight  easier, individual

characters receive fewer XP.)

Chapter 3,  "Creating Adventures," provides

guidelines for designing combat encounters using

experience points.

ABSENT  CHARACTERS

Typically, adventurers earn experience only for

encounters they participate in. If a player is absent

for a session, the player's character misses out on the

experience points.

Over time, you might end up with a level gap between

the characters of players who never miss a session and

characters belonging to  players who a re more sporadic

in their attendance. Nothing is wrong with that. A gap

of two or three levels between different characters in

the same party isn't going to  ruin the game for anyone.

Some DMs treat XP as a reward for participating in

the game, and keeping up with the rest of the party is

good incentive for  players to attend as many sessions

as possible.

As an alternative, give absent characters the same

XP that the other characters earned each session,

keeping the group at the same level. Few players

will intentionally miss out on the fun of gaming just

because they know they'll receive XP for  it even if they

don't show up.

NONCOMBAT CHALLE ..  GES ------:-

You  decide whether to award experience to characters

for overcoming challenges out  ide combat. If the

adventurers complete a ten  e negotiation with a baron ,

forge a trade agreement with a clan of surly dwa rves,

or successfully navigate the Chasm of Doom , yo u might

decide that they deserve an XP  rewa rd.

As a starting point, use the rules  fo r building combat

encounters in chapter 3 to gauge the difficulty of the

challenge. Then award the cha racters XP as if it had

been a combat encounter of the same difficulty, but only

if the encounter involved a meaningful risk of fa ilure.

MILESTONES

You  can also award XP when characters complete

significant milestones. When preparing your adventure,

designate certain events or challenges as milestones, as

with the following exampl es:

Accomplishing one in a series of goals necessary to

complete the adventure.

Discovering a hidden location or piece of information

relevant to the adventure.

Reaching an important destination.

When awarding XP,  treat a major milestone as a hard

encounter and a minor milestone as an easy encounter.

If you want to reward your players for their progress

through an adventure with something more than XP

and treasure, give them additional small rewards at

milestone points. Here are some examples:

The adventurers gain the benefit of a short rest.

Characters can recover a Hit Die or a low-level

spell slot.

Characters can regain the use of magic items that

have had their limited uses expended.

LEVEL ADVANCEMENT WITHOUT XP

You  can do away with experience points entirely and

control the rate of character advancement. Advance

characters based on how many sessions they play, or

when they accomplish significant story goals in  the

campaign. In either case, you tell the players when their

characters gain a level.

This method of level advancement can be particularly

helpful if your campaign doesn't include much

combat, or includes so much combat that tracking XP

becomes tiresome.

SESSION- BASED ADVANCEMENT

A good rate of session-based advancement is to have

characters reach 2nd level after the first session of play,

3rd level after another session, and 4th level after two

more sessions. Then spend two or three sessions for

each subsequent level.  This rate mirrors the standard

rate  of advancement, assuming sessions are about four

hours long.

STORY- BASED ADVANCEMENT

When you let the story of the campaign drive

advancement, you award levels when adventurers

accomplish significant goals in  the campaign.

CHAPTER 9:  DuNGEON  MASTER's WoRKSHOP

S  THE D UNGEON  M AS TER , YO U AREN'T LIMITED

by the rules in the Player's Handbook , the

guidelines in this book, or the selection of

monsters in the Monster Manual. You can

let your imagination run wild. T his chapter

contains optional rules that you can use to

customize your campaign, as well as guidelines on

creating your own material , such as monsters and

magic items.

The options in this chapter relate to many different

parts of the game. Some of them are variants of

rules, a nd others are entirely new rules. Each option

represents a different genre, style of play, or both.

Consider trying no more than one or two of the options

at a time so that you can clearly assess their effects on

your campaign before adding other options.

Before you add a new rule to your campaign, ask

yourself two questions:

Will the rule improve the game?

Will my players like it?

If you're confident that the answer to  both questions is

yes, then you have nothing to  lose by giving it a try.  Urge

your players to  provide feedback. If the rule or game

element isn't functioning as intended or isn't adding

much to your game, you can refine it or ditch it.  No

matter what a rule's source, a rule serves you, not the

other way around.

Beware of adding anything to your game that allows

a character to concentrate on more than one effect at

a time, use more than one reaction or bonus action

per round , or attune to more than three magic items

at a time. Rules and game elements that override the

rules for concentration, reactions , bonus actions, and

magic item attunement can seriously unbalance or

overcomplicate your game.

ABILITY OPTIONS

The optional rules in this section pertain to  using

ability scores.

PROFICIENCY DICE

-----------------

T his optional rule replaces a character's proficiency

bonus with a proficiency die, adding more ra ndomness

to the game and making proficiency a less reliable

ind icator of mastery. Instead of adding a proficiency

bonus to  an ability check, an attack roll, or saving throw,

the character's player rolls a die.  The Proficiency Die

table shows which die or dice to roll, as determined by

the character's level.

Whenever a feature, such as the rogue's Expertise,

lets a cha racter double his or her proficiency bonus,

the player rolls the character's proficiency die twice

instead of once.

This option is intended for player characters and

non player characters who have levels, as opposed to

monsters who don't.

1d12

A skill dictates the circumstances under which a

character can add his or her proficiency bonus to a n

ability check. Skills define those circumstances by

referring to  different aspects of the six ability scores.

For example, Acrobatics and Stealth are two different

aspects of Dexterity, and a character can specialize in

either or both.

You  can dispense with skills and  use one of the

following variants. Choose whichever one best suits

your campaign.

ABILITY CHECK PROFICIENCY

With this variant rule, characters don't have skill

proficiencies. Instead, each character has proficiency

in two abilities: one tied to the character's class and

one tied to  the character's background. The Ability

Proficiencies by Class table suggests a proficiency for

each class, and you choose which ability is tied to a

given background. Starting at 1st level, a character adds

his or her proficiency bonus to any ability check tied to

one or the other of these two abilities.

ABILITY  CHECK  PROFICIENCIES  BY  CLASS

The Expertise feature works differently than normal

under this rule. At 1st level, instead of choosing two

skill  proficiencies, a character with the Expertise class

feature chooses  one of the abilities in which he or she

has proficiency. Selecting an ability counts as two

of the character's  Expertise choices. If the character

would ga in an additional skill proficiency, that character

instead selects a nother ability check in which to gain

profi ciency.

H  PTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S WORKSHOP

This option removes skills from the game and

doesn't allow for much distinction among characters.

For example, a character can't choose to emphasize

persuasion or intimidation; he or she is equally

adept at both.

BACKGROUND  PROFICIENCY

With this variant rule, characters don't have skill or tool

proficiencies. Anything that would grant the character

a skill or tool proficiency provides no benefit. Instead,

a character can add his or her proficiency bonus to any

ability check to which the character's prior training and

experience (reflected in the character's background)

reasonably applies. The DM is the ultimate judge of

whether the character's background applies.

For example, the player of a character with the noble

background could reasonably argue that the proficiency

bonus should apply to a Charisma check the character

makes to  secure an audience with the king. The player

should be encouraged to explain in specific terms how

the character's background applies. Not simply "I'm

a noble," but "I spent three years before starting my

adventuring career serving as my family's ambassador

to the court, and this sort of thing is second nature

to me now."

This simple system relies heavily on players

developing their characters' histories. Don't let it

result in endless debates about whether a character's

proficiency bonus applies in a given situation. Unless

a player's attempt to explain the relevance of the

character's background makes everyone else at the table

roll their eyes at its absurdity, go ahead and reward the

player for  making the effort.

If a character has the Expertise feature,  instead

of choosing skills and tools to gain the benefit of

that feature, the player defines aspects of his or her

background to which the benefit applies. Continuing

the noble example, the player might decide to  apply

Expertise to "situations where courtly manners and

etiquette are paramount" and "figuring out the secret

plots that court members hatch against one another."

PERSONALITY TRAIT PROFICIENCY

With this variant rule, characters don't have skill

proficiencies. Instead, a character can add his or her

proficiency bonus to any ability check directly related to

the character's positive personality traits. For example,

a character with a positive personality trait of "I  never

have a plan, but I'm great at making things up as I go

along" might apply the bonus when engaging in some

off-the-cuff deception to get out of a tight spot. A player

should come up with at least four positive personalit)l

traits when creating a character.

When a character's negative personality trait directly

impacts an ability check, the character has disadvantage

on the check. For example, a hermit whose negative

trait is "I often get lost in my own thoughts and

contemplation, oblivious to  my surroundings" might

have disadvantage on an ability check made to notice

creatures sneaking up.

If a character has the Expertise feature , the player can

apply its benefit to personality traits related to  ability

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP

checks,  instead of to skills or tools. If a character would

gain a new skill or tool proficiency, the character instead

gains a new positive personality trait.

This system relies heavily on players developing

their characters' personalities. Make sure that different

characters' traits- positive and negative- come into play

with about the same frequency. Don't let a player get

away with a positive trait that always seems to  apply and

a  negative trait that never does.

At your discretion, you can also tie a character's

ideals, bonds, and flaws to this system.

HERO  POINTS

Hero points work well  in  epic fantasy and mythic

campaigns in which the characters are meant to be

more like superheroes than the average adventurer is .

With this option, a character starts with 5 hero point

at 1st level. Each time the character gains a level, he or

she loses any unspent hero points and gains a new total

equal to 5 + half the character's level.

A player can spend a hero point whenever he or she

makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw

The player can spend the hero point after the roll is

made but before any of its results are applied. Spend in_

the hero point allows the player to roll a d6 and add it

to  the d20, possibly turning a failure into a success. A

player can spend only 1 hero point per roll.

In addition, whenever a character fails a death saving

throw, the player can spend one hero point to turn the

failure into a success.

NEW ABILITY SCORES:

HONOR AND  SANITY

If you're running a campaign shaped by a strict code of

honor or the constant risk of insanity, consider adding

one or both these new ability scores: Honor and S ani _

These abilities function like the standard six abilities.

with exceptions specified in each ability below.

Here's how to  incorporate these optional abilities at

character creation:

If your players use the standard array of ability

scores, add one 11  to the array for each optional

ability you add.

If your players use the optional point-buy system, add

3 points to the number of points for each optional

ability you add.

If your players roll their ability scores , have them roll

for  the added ability scores.

If you ever need to make a check or saving throw for

Honor or Sanity for a monster that lacks the score, you

can use Charisma for  Honor and Wisdom for Sanity.

HoNOR ScoRE

If your campaign involves cultures where a rigid code

of honor is part of daily life, consider using the Honor

score as a  means of measuring a character's devotion

to that code. This ability fits well in a setting inspired

by Asian cultures, such as Kara-Tur in the Forgotten

Realms. The Honor ability is also useful in any

campaign that revolves  around orders of knights.

Honor measures not only a character's devotion to a

code but also the character's understand ing of it. The

Honor score can also reflect how others perceive a

character's honor. A character with a high Honor usually

has a reputation that others know about, especia lly

those who have high Honor scores themselves.

Unlike other abilities, Honor can't be raised with

normal ability score increases. Instead, you  can award

increases to Honor- or impose reductions- based on

a character's actions. At the end of an adventure, if you

think a character's actions in the adventure reflected

well or poorly on  his or her understanding of the code,

you can increase or decrease the character's Honor by

1. As with other ability scores, a character's Honor can't

exceed 20 or fall  below 1.

Honor Checks. Honor checks can be used in social

situations, much as Charisma would, when a character's

understanding of a code of conduct is the most defining

factor in the way a social interaction will play out.

You  might also call for an Honor check when a

character is in one of the following situations:

Being unsure how to act with honor

Surrendering while trying to save face

Trying to  determine another character's Honor score

Trying to  use the proper etiquette in a delicate

social situation

Using his or her honorable or dishonorable reputation

to  influence someone else

Honor Saving Throws. An Honor saving throw

comes into play when you want to  determine whether

a character might inadvertently do something

dishonorable. You  might call for an Honor saving throw

in the following situations:

Avoiding an accidental breach of honor or etiquette

Resisting the urge to  respond to goading or insults

from an enemy

Recognizing when an enemy attempts to  trick a

character into a breach of honor

SANITY ScoRE

Consider using the Sanity score if your campaign

revolves around entities of an utterly alien and

unspeakable nature, such as Great Cthulhu , whose

powers and minions can shatter a character's mind.

A character with a high Sanity is level-headed even in

the face of insane circumstances, while a character with

low Sanity is unsteady, breaking easily when confronted

by eldritch horrors that are beyond norma l reason.

Sanity Checks. You might ask cha racters to  make a

Sanity check in  place of an Intelligence check to  recall

lore about the alien creatures of madness featured

in your campaign, to decipher the writings of raving

lunatics, or to  learn spells from  tomes of forbidden lore.

You  might also call for a Sanity check when a character

tries one of the following activities:

Deciphering a piece of text written in a la nguage so

alien that it threatens to  break a character's mind

Overcoming the lingering effects of madness

Comprehending a piece of alien magic foreign to all

normal understanding of magic

Sanity Saving Throws. You  might call for a Sanity

saving throw when a character runs the risk of

succumbing to madness, such as in the following

situations:

Seeing a creature from the Far Realm or other alien

realms for  the first time

Making direct contact with th e mind of an

alien creature

Bei ng subjected to spells that affect mental stability,

such as the insanity option of the symbol spell

Passing through a demiplane built on alien physics

Resisting an effect conferred by an attack or spell that

deals psychic damage

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP

A fa iled Sanity save might result in short-term, long

term , or indefinite madness, as described in chapter 8 ,

"Running the Game." Any time a character suffers fro m

long-term or indefinite madness, the character's Sanity

is reduced by  1. A greater restoration spell can restore

Sanity lost in  this way, and a character can increase his

or her Sanity through level advancement.

ADVENTURING  OPTIONS

This section provides  options for changing how rests

work, as well as for adding unusual things to your

campaign , such as modern weapons.

FEAR AND  HORROR

The rules for fear and horror can help you sustain an

atmosphere of dread in a dark fantasy campaign.

FEAR

When adventurers confront threats they have no

hope of overcoming, you can call  for  them to  make a

Wisdom saving throw. Set the DC according to the

circumstances . A character who fails th e save becomes

frightened for  1 minute . The character can repeat the

saving throw at the end of each of his or her turns,

ending the effect on the character on a successful save.

HORROR

Horror involves more than simple fright.  It entails

revulsion and anguish. Often it arises when adventurer

see something completely contrary to  the common

understanding of what can and should  occur in  the

world, or upon the realization of a dreadful truth.

In such a situation , you can call on characters to make

a Charisma saving throw to resist the horror. Set the DC

based on the magnitude of the horrific circumstances.

On a failed save, a character gains a short-term or long

term form of madness that you choose or determine

randomly, as detailed in chapter 8 , "Running the Ga me.-

HEALING

These optional rules make it easier or harder for

adventurers to recover from  injury, either increasing

or reducing the amount of time your players can spend

adventuring before rest is required.

HEALER'S  KIT DEPENDENCY

A character can't spend any Hit Dice after finishing a

short rest until someone expends one use of a healer's

kit to bandage and treat the character's wounds.

HEALING SuRGES

This optional rule allows characters to  heal up in

the thick of combat and works well for  parties that

feature few or no characters with healing magic, or for

campaigns in which magical healing is rare.

As an action, a character can use a healing surge and

spend up to half his or her Hit Dice. For each Hit Die

spent in this way,  the player rolls the die and adds the

character's Constitution modifier. The character regains

hit points equal to  the total.  T he player can decide to

spend an additiona l Hit Die after each roll.

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP

A character who uses a healing surge ca n't do so

again until he or she finishes a short or long rest.

Under this optional rule, a character regains all spent

firearms might appear. The Firearms table provides

exa mples of firearms from  all  three of those periods.

The modern and fu turistic items are priceless.

Hit Dice at the end of a long rest. With a short rest,

a character regains Hit Dice equal to  his or her level

divided by four (minimum of one die).

For a more superheroic feel, you can let a character

use a healing surge as a bonus action, rather than as

an action.

SLOW NATURAL HEALING

Characters don't regain hit points at the end of a long

rest. Instead , a character can spend Hit Dice to heal at

the end of a long rest, just as with a short rest.

This optional rule prolongs the amount of time that

characters need to recover from their wounds without

the benefits of magical healing and works well for

grittier, more realistic campaigns.

REST VARIANTS

The rules for short and long rests presented in chapter

8  of the Player's Handbook work well for a heroic-style

campaign. Characters can go toe-to-toe with deadly foes ,

take damage to within an inch of their lives, yet still be

ready to fight again the next day.  If this approach doesn't

fit your campaign, consider the following variants.

EPIC  HEROISM

This variant uses a short rest of 5 minutes and a long

rest of 1 hour. This change makes combat more routine,

since characters can easily recover from every battle.

You  might want to make combat encounters more

difficult to compensate.

Spellcasters using this system can afford to  burn

through spell slots quickly, especially at higher levels.

Consider allowing spellcasters to  restore expended

spell slots equal to only half their maximum spell slots

(rounded down) at the end of a long rest, and to  limit

spell  slots restored to 5th level or lower.  Only a full

8-hour rest will allow a spellcaster to  restore all spell

slots and to  regain spell slots of 6th level or higher.

GRITTY REALISM

This variant uses a short rest of 8  hours and a long

rest of 7 days. This puts the brakes on  the campaign,

requiring the players to carefully judge the benefits

and drawbacks of combat. Characters can't affo rd to

engage in too many battles in a row.  and all adventuring

requires careful planning.

This approach encourages the characters to

spend time out of the dungeon. It"  a good option for

campaigns that emphasize intrigue. politics. and

interactions among other  PCs. and in  which combat is

rare or something to be avoided rather rhan rushed into.

FIREARMS

If you want to model the swa  hbuckling  r.yle of

The  Three Musketeers and  imilar tale  . you can

introduce gunpowder weapon  ro your campaign that

are associated with the Renaissance.

PROFICIENCY

It's up to you to  decide whether a character has

proficiency with a firearm . Characters in most D&D

worlds wouldn't have such profici ency. During their

downtime, characters can use the training ru les in the

Player 's Handbook to acq uire proficiency, assuming

that they  have enough am muniti on to keep the weapons

working while mastering their use.

PROPERTIES

Firea rms  use special ammuniti on, and some of them

have the burst fire or reload property.

Ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is

destroyed  upon use. Renaissance and modern firearms

use bullets.  Futuris tic firearms are powered by a

specia l type of a mmunition ca lled energy cells. An

energy cell  conta ins enough power for all  the shots its

firearm can make.

Burst Fire. A weapon that has the burst fire property

can make a normal single-target attack, or it can spray a

10-foot-cube area within normal range w ith shots. Each

creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity

saving th row or take the weapon's  normal damage. This

action uses ten pieces of ammuni tion.

Reload. A limited number of shots can be made with

a weapon that has the reload property. A character must

then reload it  using an action or a bonus action (the

character's choice).

EXPLOSIVES

A campaign might include explosives from the

Renaissance or the modern world (the latter are

priceless), as presented in the Explosives table.

BOMB

As an action, a character can li ght this  bomb and throw

it at a point up to 60 feet away. Each creature within 5

feet of that point must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity

saving throw or take 3d6 fire damage.

GUNPOWDER

Gunpowder is chiefly used to  propel a bu 11et out of the

barrel of a pistol or rifle,  or it is  formed into a bomb.

Gunpowder is sold in small wooden kegs and in water

resistant powder horns.

S etting fire  to a container full  of gunpowder can cause

it to explode,  dealing fire dam age to creatures with in

10 feet of it (3d6 for a powder horn , 7d6 for a keg). A

successful  DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the

damage. Setting fi re to an ounce of gunpowder causes

it  to flare for  1 round, s hedding br ight light in a 30-foot

radius and dim light for an add itional 30 feet.

DYNAMITE

As an action, a creature can light a stick of dynamite

and throw it at a point up to  60 feet away. Each creature

within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 12 Dexterity

saving throw, taking 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a

fail ed save, or half as much damage on a successful  one.

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP

A character can bind sticks of dynamite together so

they explode at the same time. Each additional stick

increases the damage by  1d6 (to a maximum of 10d6)

a nd  the burst radius by 5 feet (to  a maximum of 20 feet).

Dynamite can be rigged with a longer fuse to explode

after a set amount of time, usually 1 to  6 rounds. Roll

initiative for  the dynamite. After the set number of

rounds goes by,  the dynamite explodes on that initiative.

GRENADES

As a n action, a character can throw a grenade at a

point up to  60 feet away. With a grenade launcher, the

character can propel the grenade up to  120 feet away.

Each creature within 20 feet of an exploding

fragmentation grenade must make a DC 15 Dexterity

saving throw, taking 5d6 piercing damage on a failed

save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

One round after a smoke grenade lands, it emits a

cloud of smoke that creates a heavily obscured area in

a 20-foot radius. A moderate wind (at  least 10 miles per

hour) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind

(20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round.

ALIEN TECHNOLOGY

When adve nturers find a piece of technology that isn't

from  their world or time period , the players might

understand what the object is, but the characters

rarely wi ll.  To simulate a character's ignorance about

the technology, have the character make a series of

Intelligence checks to figure it out.

To  determine how the technology works , a character

must succeed on a number of Intelligence checks

based on the complexity of the item: two successes for

a simple item (such as a cigarette lighter, calculator, or

revolver) and fou r successes for a complex item (such a

a computer, chainsaw, or hovercra ft).  Then consult the

Figuring Out Alien Technology table. Consider making

the item break if a character fail s four or more times

before taking a long rest.

A character who has seen a n item used or has

operated a similar item  has advantage on Intelligence

checks made to  figure out its use.

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP

PLOT POINTS

Plot points allow players to change the course of the

campaign, introduce plot complications, alter the

world, and even assume the role of the DM. If your first

reaction to reading this optional rule is to worry that

your players might abuse it, it's probably not for you.

USING PLOT POINTS

Each player starts with 1 plot point. During a session,

a player can spend that point for one effect. The effect

depends on your group's  approach to this optional rule.

Three options are presented below.

A player can spend no more than  1 plot point

per session. You  can increase this limit if you like,

especially if you want the players to drive more of the

story. Once every player at the table has spent a plot

point, they each gain 1 plot point.

OPTION 1:  WHAT A  TWIST!

A player who spends a plot point gets to add some

element to  the setting or situation that the group

(including you) must accept as true. For example, a

player can spend a plot point and state that his or her

character has found a secret door, an NPC appears, or

a  monster turns out to be a long-lost ally polymorphed

into a horrid beast.

A player who wants to  spend a plot point in this way

should  take a minute to discuss his or her idea with

everyone else at the table and get feedback before

settling on a plot development.

OPTION 2:  THE PLOT THICKENS

Whenever a player spends a plot point, the player to  his

or her right must add a complication to the scene. For

example, if the player who spends the plot point decides

that her character has found a secret door, the player

to the right might state that opening the door triggers a

magical trap that teleports the party to  another part of

the dungeon.

OPTION  3:  THE  GODS  MUST BE  CRAZY

With this approach, there is no permanent DM.

Everyone makes a character, and one person starts as

the DM and runs the game as normal. That person's

character becomes an NPC who can tag along with the

group or remain on the sidelines, as the group wishes.

At any time, a player can spend a plot point to become

the DM.  That player's character becomes an NPC, and

play continues. It's probably not a good idea to swap

roles in the middle of combat, but it ca n happen if your

group allows time for the new DM to settle into his or

her role and pick up where the previous DM left off.

Using plot points in this way can make for an

exciting campaign as each new DM  steers the game in

unexpected directions. This approach is also a great

way for would-be DMs to try running a game in small,

controlled doses.

In a campaign that uses plot points this way,  everyone

should come to  the table with a  bit of materia l prepared

or specific encounters in mind. A player who isn't

prepared or who doesn't feel  like DMing can choose

to not spend a plot point that session.

For this approach to work, it's a good idea to establish

some sha red assumptions about the campaign so that

DMs aren't duplicating efforts or trampling on each

other's plans.

COMBAT OPTIONS

The options in this section provide alternative ways to

handle combat. The main risk of adding some of these

rules is slowing down play.

INITIATIVE VARIANTS - - - -

This section offers different ways to handle initiative.

INITIATIVE  ScoRE

With this optional rule, creature don't roll  initiative

at the start of combat. Instead, each creature has an

initiative score, which is a passive Dexterity check:

10 +Dexterity modifier.

By cutting down on die rolls, math done on the fly,

and the process of asking for and recording totals, you

can speed your game up considerably-at the cost of an

initiative order that is often predictable.

SIDE  INITIATIVE

Recording initiative for each PC and monster, arrangi n

everyone in  the correct order, and remembering where

you are in  the list can bog the game down. If you want

quicker combats, at the risk of those combats becoming

unbalanced, try using the side initiative rule.

Under this variant, the players roll a d20 for  their

initiative as a group, or side. You also roll a d20. Neither

roll receives any modifiers. Whoever rolls highest wins

initiative. In case of a tie,  keep rerolling until the tie

is broken.

When it's a side's turn, the members of that side can

act in any order they choose. Once everyone on the side

has taken a turn, the other side goes. A round ends

when both sides have completed their turns.

If more than two sides take part in a battle, each side

rolls for initiative. Sides act from the highest roll to

lowest. Combat continues in the initiative order until the

battle is complete.

This variant encourages teamwork and makes your

life as a DM easier, since you can more easily coordinate

monsters. On the downside, the side that wins initiative

can gang up on enemies and take them out before they

have a chance to act.

SPEED  FACTOR

Some DMs find  the regular progression of initiative

too predictable and prone to abuse. Players can use

their knowledge of the initiative order to influence their

decisions. For example, a badly wounded fighter might

charge a troll because he knows that the cleric goes

before the monster a nd can heal him.

Speed factor is an option for initiative that introduces

more uncertainty into combat, at the cost of speed of

play.  Under this variant, the participants in a battle roll

initiative each round. Before rolling, each character or

monster must choose an action.

Initiative Modifiers. Modifiers might apply to  a

eature's initiative depending on its size and the action

ra kes. For example, a creatu re that fi ghts with a light

eapon or casts a simple spell  is more likely  to act

fo re a creature armed with a heavy or slow weapon.

:ee the Speed Factor Initiative Modifiers table for

:  rails. If an action has no modifier listed, the action has

effect  on initiative. If more than one modifier applies



such as wielding a two-handed, heavy melee weapon),

.ipply them all to  the initiative roll.

Don't apply the same modifier more than once on a

creature's turn. For example, a rogue fighting with two

daggers gains the +2 bonus for  using a light or finesse

weapon only once. In the case of spellcasting, apply only

the modifier from the highest-level spell.

Apply any modifiers for  bonus actions to that

creature's turn, remembering never to apply the

same modifier twice. For instance, a paladin casts a

2nd-level spell as a bonus action and then attacks with a

hortsword. The paladin takes a -2 penalty for the spell

and gains a +2 bonus for using a light weapon, for a total

modifier of +0.

The table is only a starting point. You  can refer to it

when adjudicating any actions a character takes that

you think should be faster or slower. Quick, easy actions

hould grant a bonus, while slow, difficult ones should

incur a penalty. As a rule of thumb, apply a bonus or

penalty of 2 or 5 for an action.

For example, a fighter wants to turn a winch to  raise a

portcullis. This is a complex, difficult action. You could

ru le that it incurs a -5 initiative penalty.

Rolling Initiative. After deciding on an action,

everyone rolls initiative and applies modifiers, keeping

rhe result secret. You then announce an initiative

number, starting with 30 and working down (it helps to

call out ranges of numbers at the sta rt). Break any ties

by having the combatant with the highest Dexterity act

fi rst. Otherwise, roll to determine who goes first.

Turns. On its turn, a creature moves as normal but

must take the action it selected or ta ke no action at all.

Once everyone has acted, the process  repeats.

Everyone in the battle selects an action. rolls initiative,

and takes turns in order.

ACTION  OPTIO NS

This s ection provides new action options for combat.

They can be added as a group or individually to

your game.

CLIMB  ONTO A  BIGGER  CREATURE

If one creature wants to jump onto a nother creature, it

can do so by grappling. A Small or Medium creature has

little chance of making a successful grapple against a

Huge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless magic

has granted the grappler supernatural might.

As an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be

treated as terrain for  the purpose of jumping onto its

back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability

checks necessary to  get into position and onto the larger

creature, the sma ller creature uses its action to make

a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check

contested by the target's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully

moves into the target creature's space and clings to its

body. While in the target's space, the smaller creature

moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls

against it.

The smaller creature can move around within the

larger creature's space, treating th e space as  difficult

terrain. The larger creature's ability to attack the

smaller creature depends on the smaller creature's

location , and is left  to your discretion. The larger

creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an

action- knocking it off, scraping it against a wall,

or grabbing and throwing it- by making a Strength

(Athletics) check contested by the smaller creature's

Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

The smaller creature chooses which ability to  use.

DISARM

A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon

or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker

makes an attack roll contested by the target's Strength

(Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the

attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage

or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item.

The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if

the target is holding the item with two or more ha nds.

The target has advantage on its ability check if it is

larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it

is smaller.

MARK

This option makes it easier for  melee combatants to

harry each other with opportunity attacks.

When a creature makes a melee attack, it can also

mark its target. Until the end of the attacker's next turn ,

any opportunity attack it makes against the marked

target has advantage. The opportunity attack doesn't

expend the attacker's reaction , but the attacker can't

make the attack if anything, such as the incapacitated

condition or the shocking grasp spell, is preventing it

from taking reactions. The attacker is limited to one

opportunity attack per turn.

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP

OVERRUN

When a creature tries to  move through a hostile

creature's space, the mover can try to force its way

through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an

action or a bonus action, the mover makes a Strength

(Athletics) check contested by the hostile creature's

Strength (Athletics) check. The creature attempting the

overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than

the hostile creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller. If

the mover wins the contest, it can move through the

hostile creature's space once this turn.

SHOVE ASIDE

With this option, a creature uses the special shove

attack from  the Player's Handbook to force a  target

to  the side, rather than away. The attacker has

disadvantage on its Strength (Athletics) check when it

does so. If that check is successful, the attacker moves

the target 5 feet to a different space within its reach .

TUMBLE

A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature's

space, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As an

action or a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity

(Acrobatics) check contested by the hostile creature's

Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the tumbler wins the

contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space

once this turn.

HITTING  COVER

When a ranged attack misses a target that has cover,

you can use this optional rule to  determine whether the

cover was struck by the attack.

First, determine whether the attack roll would have

hit the protected target without the cover. If the attack

roll falls within a range low enough to miss the target

but high enough to strike the target if there had been

no cover, the object used for cover is struck. If a creature

is providing cover for  the missed creature and the

attack roll  exceeds the AC  of the covering creature, the

covering creature is hit.

CLEAVING THROUGH  CREATURES

If your player characters regularly fight hordes of lower

level monsters, consider using this optional rule to help

speed up such fights.

When a melee attack reduces an undamaged creature

to  0 hit points, any excess damage from  that attack

might carry over to another creature nearby. The

attacker targets another creature within reach and, if

the original attack roll can hit it, applies any remaining

damage to it.  If that creature was undamaged and is

likewise reduced to  0 hit points, repeat this process,

carrying over the remaining damage until there are no

valid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to

reduce an undamaged creature to 0 hit points.

INJURIES _ __  _

Damage normally leaves no lingering effects. This

option introduces the potential for long-term injuries.

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP

It's up to you to decide when to check for a lingering

injury.  A creature might sustain a lingering injury under

the following circumstances:

When it takes a critical hit

When it drops to 0 hit points but isn't killed outright

When it fails a death saving throw by 5 or more

To determine the nature of the injury, roll on the

Lingering Injuries table. This table assumes a typical

humanoid physiology, but you can adapt the results for

creatures with different body types.

LINGERING  INJURIES

5-7

Lose  an  Eye.  You  have disadvantage on Wisdom

(Perception)  checks that rely on  sight and  on

ranged attack rolls.  Magic such  as  the regenerate

spell  can  restore the lost eye.  If you  have  no  eyes

left after sustaining this  injury,  you're  blinded.

Lose  an  Arm  or a Hand. You  can  no  longer  hold

anything with  two  hands, and you  can  hold  only a

single object at a time.  Magic such as the regenera te

spell  can  restore the lost appendage.

Lose a Foot or Leg.  Your  speed on  foot  is  halved,

and you  must use a cane or crutch to move  unless

you  have a peg leg or other prosthesis. You  fall

prone after using the Dash  action. You  have

disadvantage on  Dexterity checks made to  balance.

Magic such  as  the regenerate  spell  can  restore the

lost appendage.

Limp. Your  speed on  foot  is  reduced  by  5 feet.  You

must make a  DC  10  Dexterity saving throw after

using the  Dash  action.  If you  fail  the save, you  fall

prone.  Magical  healing  removes the  limp.

Internal  Injury. Whenever you  attempt an  action

in  combat, you  must make  a DC  15  Constitution

saving throw.  On  a failed  save, you  lose your action

and  can't use  reactions  until  the start of your  next

turn. The injury  heals  if you  receive  magical  healing

or  if you  spend ten days  doing nothing but  resting.

8-10  Broken  Ribs. This  has the same effect as  Internal

Injury above,  except that the save DC  is  10.

11-13  Horrible Scar. You  are disfigured  to the extent that

the wound can't be easily concealed . You  have

disadvantage on  Charisma  (Persuasion)  checks

and  advantage on  Charisma  (Intimidation)  checks .

Magical  healing of 6th  level  or higher,  such as  heal

and  regenerate,  removes the scar.

14-16  Festering Wound . Your  hit  point maximum  is

reduced  by  1 every  24  hours the wound  persists.

If your hit  point maximum drops to 0,  you  die .

The wound  heals  if you  receive  magical  healing.

Alternatively, someone can  tend to the wound  and

make a  DC  15  Wisdom  (Medicine)  check once eve ry

24  hours. After ten successes, the wound  heals.

17-20  Minor Scar.  The  scar doesn't have any  adverse

effect.  Magica l healing of 6th  level  or higher,  such

as  heal and regenerate,  removes the scar.

Instead of using the effect described in  the table, you

can put the responsibility of representing a character's

lingering injury in the hands of the player. Roll on the

Lingering Injuries table as usual, but instead of suffering

the effect described for that resu lt, that character gains

a new flaw with the same name. It's  up to  the player to

express the lingering injury during play, just like any

other flaw,  with the potential to gain inspiration when

the injury affects the character in a meaningful way.

MASSIVE  DAMAGE

This optional rule makes it easier for a creature to  be

felled by massive damage.

When a creature takes damage from a single source

equal to  or greater than half its hit point maximum, it

must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw

or suffer a random effect determined by a roll on the

System Shock table. For example, a creature that has a

hit point maximum of 30 must make that Constitution

save if it takes 15 damage or more from a single source.

SYSTEM  SHOCK

Effect

The creature drops to 0  hit points .

2-3  The creature drops to 0  hit  points  but is  stable.

4-5  The creature is stunned  until  the end of its  next turn .

6-7  The creature can't take reactions and  has

disadvantage on  attack rolls  and  ability checks  until

the end of its  next turn.

8-10  The creature can't take reactions  unti l the end of its

next turn.

MORALE

Some combatants might run away when a fight  turns

against them. You  can use this optional rule to help

determine when monsters and NPCs flee.

A creature might flee  under any of the following

circumstances:

The creature is surprised.

The creature is reduced to  half its hit points or fewer

for  the first time in the battle.

The creature has no way to harm the opposing side

on its turn.

A group of creatures might flee under any of the

following circumstances:

All  the creatures in the group are surprised.

The group's leader is reduced to  0 hit points,

incapacitated, taken prisoner, or removed from battle.

The group is reduced to half its original size with no

losses on the opposing side.

To determine whether a creature or group of

creatures flees,  make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw

for the creature or the group's leader.  If the opposition

is overwhelming, the saving throw is made with

disadvantage, or you can decide that the save fails

automatically. If a group's leader can't make the saving

throw for whatever reason, have the creature in the

group with the next highest Charisma score make the

saving throw instead.

On a failed save, the affectedereature or group flees

by the most expeditious route. If escape is impossible,

the creature or group surrenders. If a creature or group

that surrenders is attacked by its conquerors, the battle

might resume, and it's unlikely that further attempts to

flee or surrender will be made.

A failed saving throw isn't always to  the adventurers'

benefit. For exa mple, an ogre that flees from combat

might put the rest of the dungeon on alert or run off with

treasure that the characters had hoped to  plunder.

CREATING A  MONSTER

The Monster Manual contains hundreds of ready-to-play

monSters, but it doesn't include every monster that you

can imagine. Part of the D&D experience is the simple

joy of creating new monsters and customizing existing

ones, if for  no other reason than to surprise and delight

your players with something they've never faced before.

The first step in the process is coming up with the

concept for your monster. What makes it unique? Where

does it live? What role do you want it  to serve in your

adventure, your campaign, or your world? What does

it look like? Does it have any weird abilities? Once you

have the answers to  these questions, you can start

figuring out how to represent your monster in the game.

MODIFYING A  MONSTER

Once you have an idea for a monster, you'll need

statistics to represent it. The first question you should

ask yourself is:  Can I use statistics that already exist?

A stat block in the Monster Manual might make a

good starting point for your monster. Imagine, for

example, that you want to create an intelligent a rboreal

predator that hunts elves. There is no such monster

in the Monster Manual,  but the quaggoth is a savage

humanoid predator with a climbing speed. You could

borrow the quaggoth stat block for your new monster,

changing nothing but the creature's name. You  can also

make minor tweaks, such as replacing the quaggoth's

language, Undercommon, with one that's more

appropriate, such as Elvish or Sylvan.

Need a fiery phoenix? Take the giant eagle or roc, give

it immunity to fire,  and allow it to deal fire damage with

its attacks. Need a flying monkey? Consider a baboon

with wings and a flying speed. Almost any monster you

can imagine can be built using one that already exists.

Adapting a stat block is far less time-consuming than

creating one from scratch, and there are changes you

can make to an existing monster that have no effect

on its challenge rating, such as swapping languages,

changing its alignment, or adding special senses.

However, once you change the creature's offensive or

defensive ability, such as its hit points or damage, its

challenge rating might need to change, as shown later.

S W ITC HING WEAPONS

If a monster wields a manufactured weapon, you can

replace that weapon with a different one.  For example,

you could replace a hobgoblin's longsword with a

halberd. Don't forget to change the damage and the

attack's reach where appropriate. Also be aware of the

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP

273

consequences of switching from a one-handed weapon

to a two-handed weapon, or vice versa. For example,  a

hobgoblin wielding a halberd (a two-handed weapon)

loses the benefit of its shield, so its AC decreases by 2.

ADDING  A  SPECIAL TRAIT

Another simple way to customize a monster is to add

a special trait. You can add a special trait of your own

devising or pick up a special trait from one of the many

creatures in the Monster Manual.  For example, you can

create a goblin-spider hybrid by giving the normal goblin

the Spider Climb special trait, turn an ordinary troll  into

a two-headed troll by giving it the Two Heads special

trait, or turn an owlbear into a flying owlbear by giving it

wings and a giant owl's flying speed.

particular challenge rating, follow  the steps here. If you

want to create something more akin to  the monster

stat blocks in the Monster Manual,  skip ahead to the

"Creating a Monster Stat Block" section.

STEP 1.  EXPECTED  CHALLENGE  RATING

Pick the expected challenge rating (CR) for your

monster. Knowing the monster's expected challenge

rating will help you figure out the monster's proficiency

bonus and other important combat statistics. Don't

worry about getting the challenge rating exactly right;

you can make adjustments in later steps.

A single monster with a challenge rating equal to

the adventurers' level is, by itself, a fair challenge for a

group of four characters. If the monster is meant to  be

fought in pairs or groups, its expected challenge rating

should be lower than the party's level.

Don't fall  into the trap of thinking that your monster

must have a challenge rating equal to the level of the

characters to  be a worthy challenge. Keep in mind that

monsters with a lower challenge rating can be a threat

to  higher-level characters when encountered in groups.

STEP  2. BASIC  STATISTICS

Use the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table to

determine the monster's Armor Class, hit points, attack

bonus, and damage output per round based on the

challenge rating you chose in step 1.

STEP 3.  ADJUST STATISTICS

Raise or lower the monster's Armor Class, hit points,

attack bonus, damage output per round, and save DC as

you see fit,  based on whatever concept you have in  mind

for the monster. For example, if you need a well-armored

monster, increase its Armor Class.

Once you've made the desired adjustments, record

the monster's statistics. If there are any other statistics

you think the monster needs (such as ability scores),

follow the appropriate steps under "Creating a Monster

Stat Block."

STEP 4.  FINAL CHALLENGE  RATING

Calculate the monster's final challenge rating,

accounting for the adjustments you made in step 3.

Defensive Challenge Rating. Read down the Hit

Points column of the Monster Statistics by Challenge

Rating table until you find your monster's hit points.

Then look across and note the challenge rating

suggested for a monster with those hit points.

Now look at the Armor Class suggested for a monster

of that challenge rating. If your monster's AC is at least

two points higher or lower than that number, adjust the

challenge rating suggested by its hit points up or down

by  1 for every 2 points of difference.

Offensive Challenge Rating. Read down the Damage

Round column of the Monster Statistics by Challenge

Rating table until you find your monster's damage

output per round. Then look across and note the

challenge rating suggested for a monster that deals that

much damage.

Now look at the attack bonus suggested for a monster

of that challenge rating. If your monster's attack bonus

is at least two points higher or lower than that number,

274

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER' S  WORKSHOP

adjust the challenge rating  uggesred by its damage

output up or down by  1 for e\ery 2 points of difference.

If the monster relies more on effects with saving

throws than on attacks, use the monster's save DC

instead of its attack bonus.

If your monster uses different attack bonuses or save

DCs, use the ones that will come up the most often.

Average Challenge Rating. The monster's final

challenge rating is the average of its defensive and

offensive challenge ratings. Round the average up or

down to the nearest challenge rating to determine

your monster's final  challenge rating. For example, if

the creature's defensive challenge rating is 2 and its

offensive rating is 3, its final  rating is 3.

With the final challenge rating, you can determine the

monster's proficiency bonus using the Monster Statistics

by Challenge Rating table. Use the Experience Points

by Challenge Rating table to determine how much XP

the monster is worth. A monster of challenge rating

0 is worth 0 XP if it poses no threat. Otherwise, it is

worth 10 XP.

Creating a monster isn't just a number-crunching

exercise. The guidelines in this chapter can help you

create monsters, but the only way to know whether a

monster is fun is to playtest it. After seeing your monster

in action, you might want to adjust the challenge rating

up or down based on your experiences.

CREATING A  MONSTER STAT BLOCK

If you want a full  monster stat block, use the following

method to create your new monster.

The introduction to the Monster Manual explains all

the components of a  monster's stat block. Familiarize

yourself with that material before you begin. In the

course of creating your monster, if you find yourself

unable to make a decision, let the examples in the

Monster Manual guide you.

Once you have a monster concept in mind, follow the

steps below.

S TEP 1.  N A ME

A monster's name should be given as much

consideration as any other aspect of the monster,

if not more.

Your monster might be based on a real-world creature

or a monster from myth , in which case its name might

be obvious. If you need to  invent a name, keep in

mind that the best names either reflect the monster's

appearance or nature (such as the mimic and the

owlbear) or have a nice ring to them (such as the chuul

and the thri-kreen).

STEP  2.  SIZE

Mak6 your monster whatever size you want: Tiny, Small,

Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan.

A monster's size determines which die is used to

calculate its hit points in step 8 . Size also determines

how much space the monster occupies, as discussed in

the Player's  Handbook.

STEP 3. T Y PE

A monster's type provides insight into its origins and

nature. The Monster Manual describes each monster

type. Choose the type that best fits your concept for

the monster.

STEP 4 . ALIGNMENT

If your monster has no concept of morals , it is

unaligned. Otherwise, it has an alignment appropriate

to its nature and moral outlook, as discussed in the

Player's Handbook.

STEP 5. ABILITY SCORES AND  MODIFIERS

Monsters, like player characters, have the six ability

scores. A monster can't have a score lower than 1 or

higher than 30 in any ability.

A monster's score in any ability determines its ability

modifier, as shown in the Ability Scores and Modifiers

table in the Player's  Handbook.

If you can't decide what a monster's ability scores

should be, look for comparable monsters in the Monster

Manual and mimic their ability scores. For example,

if your monster is roughly as smart as a human

commoner, give it an Intelligence of 10 (+0 modifier).

If it's  as strong as an ogre, give it a Strength of 19 (+4

modifier).

STEP 6.  EXPECTED  CH A LLENGE  R ATING

Choose a challenge rating for your monster. See step

1 under "Creating Quick Monster Stats" for more

information. You will use the proficiency bonus in later

steps, so jot it down now or remember it.

STEP  7. ARMOR  CLASS

A monster's Armor Class has a direct bearing on its

challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine your

monster's Armor Class in one of two ways.

Use the Table. You can choose an appropriate AC

based on the monster's expected challenge rating, as

shown in the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating

table. The table provides the baseline AC for a monster

of a specific challenge rating. Feel free to adjust the

AC as you see fit.  For example, the baseline AC for a

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP

~75

challenge rating 1 monster is 13, but if your monster is

well armored, raise its AC  accordingly. Don't worry if

the monster's AC isn't matching up with the expected

challenge rating for  the monster. Other factors can affec

a monster's challenge rating, as shown in later steps.

Determine an Appropriate AC. Alternatively, you car:

determine an appropriate AC  based on the type of arm  -

the monster wears, its natural armor, or some other

Armor Class booster (such as the mage armor spell).

Again, don't worry if the monster's AC  isn't matching u

with the expected challenge rating for the monster.

If your monster wears manufactured armor, its

Armor Class is based on the type of armor worn (see

the Player's Handbook for armor types). If the monster

carries a shield, apply the shield bonus to its AC

as normal.

A monster that doesn't wear armor might have natur2

armor, in which case it has an AC equal to  10 +its

Dexterity modifier+ its natural armor bonus. A mons

with a thick hide generally has a natural armor bonu

of +1  to +3.  The bonus can be higher if the creature

is exceptionally well armored. A gorgon, for example.

is covered in steely plates and has a natural armor

bonus of+9.

STEP 8.  HIT POINTS

A monster's hit points have a direct bearing on its

challenge rating, and vice versa. You  can determine y

monster's hit points in one of two ways.



Use the Table. You  can start with the monster's

expected challenge rating and use the Monster

Statistics by Challenge Rating table to  determine an

appropriate number of hit points. The table presents a

range of hit points for each challenge rating.

Assign Hit Dice. Alternatively, you can assign a

number of Hit Dice to a monster, then calculate its

average hit points. Don't worry if the hit points aren t

matching up with the expected challenge rating for the

monster. Other factors can affect a monster's challenge

rating, as shown in later steps, and you can always

adjust a monster's Hit Dice and hit points later on.

A monster can have as many Hit Dice as you want.

but the size of the die used to  calculate its hit points

depends on the monster's size, as shown in  the Hit Di

by Size table. For example, a Medium monster uses d~:

for  hit points, so a Medium monster with 5 Hit Dice ru::

a Constitution of 13 (+1  modifier) has 5d8 +5 hit poin-"

A monster typically has average hit points based on -~

Hit Dice. For example, a creature with 5d8 + 5 hit poi

has an average of 27  hit points (5  x 4.5 + 5).

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP

STEP 9.  DAMAGE VuL "ER..'\BI LITI ES ,

RESISTANCES,  AND  hnn ; . "ITIE

Decide whether your mon  ter ha  \ulnerability,

resistance, or immunity to one or more types of

damage (see the Players Handbook for descriptions

of the various damage types). .

ign a vulnerability,

resistance, or immunity  to a  mon  ter only when it's

intuitive. For example, it make  en  e fo r a monster

made of molten lava to  have immunity to fire damage.

Giving a monster resistances and immunities to three

or more damage types (especially bludgeoning, piercing,

and slashing damage) is like gi\ing it extra hit points.

However, adventurers have more resources at higher

levels to  counteract such defense  . making resistances

and immunities less relevant at higher levels.

Effective Hit Points. If a monster has resistance

or immunity to several damage types- especially

bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from

nonmagical weapons-and not all the characters in the

party possess the means to counteract that resistance

or immunity, you need to take these defenses into

account when comparing you r monster's hit points to its

expected challenge rating. Using the Effective Hit Points

Based on Resistances and Immunities table, apply

the appropriate multiplier to the monster's hit points

to determine its effective hit points for the purpose of

gauging its final  challenge rating. (The monster's actual

hit points shouldn't change.)

For example, a monster with an expected

challenge rating of 6,  150 hit points, and resistance

to  bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from

nonmagical weapons effectively has 225 hit points

(using the 1.5 multiplier for resistances) for  the purpose

of gauging its final  challenge rating.

Monsters don't normally have vulnerability to more

than one or two types of damage. Vulnerabilities don't

significantly affect a monster's challenge rating, unless

a  monster has vulnerabilities to multiple damage types

that are prevalent, especially bludgeoning, piercing,

and slashing. For such a strange monster, reduce its

effective hit points by half. Or even better, eliminate

the vulnerabilities and give the brittle monster fewer

hit points.

STEP 10 . ATTACK BONUSES

A monster's attack bonuses have a direct bearing on its

challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine a

monster's attack bonuses in one of two ways.

Use the Table. You can start with the monster's

expected challenge rating and use the Monster

Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine an

appropriate attack bonus for all the monster's attacks,

regardless of its ability scores.

The table provides the baseline attack bonus for each

challenge rating. Feel free to adj ust the attack bonus as

you see fit  to match whatever concept you have in mind.

For example, the baseline attack bonus for a challenge

rating 1 monster is +3,  but if yo ur monster needs more

accuracy, raise its bonus accordingly. Don't worry if

the monster's attack bonus isn't matching up with the

expected challenge rating for the monster. Other factors

can affect a  monster's challenge rating, as shown in

later steps.

Calculate Attack Bonuses. Alternatively, you can

calculate a  monster's attack bonuses the same way

players calculate the attack bonuses of a character.

Wpen a monster has an action that requires an attack

roll, its attack bonus is equal to its proficiency bonus+

its Strength or Dexterity modifier. A monster usually

applies its Strength modifier to  melee attacks and its

Dexterity modifier to ranged attacks, although smaller

monsters sometimes use Dexterity for  both.

Again , don't worry if the attack bonuses aren't

matching up with the expected challenge rating for

the monster. You  can always adjust a monster's attack

bonuses later.

STEP 11.  DAMAGE

A monster's damage output- the amount of damage it

deals every round-has a direct bearing on its challenge

rating, and vice versa. You can determine a monster's

damage output in one of two ways.

Use the Table. You  can start with the monster's

expected challenge rating and use the Monster

Statistics by Challenge Rating table to  determine how

much damage the monster should deal every round.

The table presents a range at each challenge rating.

It doesn't matter how this damage is apportioned or

distributed; for example, a monster might deal the

damage every round with a single attack, or the damage

could be split among multiple attacks against one or

more foes.

Choose the type of damage based on how you imagine

the damage being delivered. For example, if the monster

is attacking with razor-sharp claws, the damage it deals

is probably slashing damage. If its claws are poisonous,

some portion of the damage might be poison damage

instead of slashing damage.

If you want the damage output to vary slightly from

round to  round, you can translate the damage range into

a single die expression (for a  monster with one attack)

or multiple die expressions (for a monster with multiple

attacks). For example, a challenge rating 2 monster

deals 15- 20 damage per round. If you imagine the

creature having a Strength of 18 (+4 modifier), you could

give it one melee attack that deals 3d8 + 4 (average

17.5) damage, split the damage output into two separate

attacks that deal1d10 + 4 (average 9) damage each; or

use any other combination where the average damage

output falls within the desired range.

Base the Damage on the Weapon. Alternatively,

you can use a die expression to  represent the damage

that a monster deals with each of its attacks based on

whatever weapon it is using.

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S WORKSHO P

actions. For example, a balor's Fire Aura deals 10

fire  damage to any creature that hits the balor with a

melee attack.  The aura also deals 10 fire damage to all

creatures within 5 feet of the balor at the start of each

of the balor's turns. If you assume that one character ~

the party is within 5 feet of the balor at all times, hittir::;

it with a melee weapon every round, then the balor's

damage output per round increases by 20.

STEP 12.  SAVE  DCs

A monster might have an attack or some other trait

that requires a target to make a saving throw. The sa,e

DCs to resist such effects have a direct bearing on the

monster's challenge rating, and vice versa. You can

determine save DCs in one of two ways.

Use the Table. You can start with the monster's

expected challenge rating and use the Monster

Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine an

appropriate save DC for any effect that requires a tar  e

to make a saving throw.

Calculate the DCs. Alternatively, you can calculate

a monster's save DCs as follows:  8 + the monster's

proficiency bonus + the monster's relevant ability

modifier. You  choose the ability that best applies.

For example, if the effect is a poison, the relevant

ability is probably the monster's Constitution. If

the effect is similar to that of a spell, the relevant

ability might be the monster's Intelligence, Wisdom,

or Charisma.

Don't worry if the save DCs aren't matching up with

the expected challenge rating for  the monster. Other

factors can affect a monster's challenge rating, as

shown in later steps, and you can always adjust the sa  -

DCs later on.

STEP 13.  SPECIAL TRAITS ,  ACTIONS,  AND

REACTIONS

Some special traits (such as Magic Resistance), specia:.

actions (such as Superior Invisibility), and special

reactions (such as Parry) can improve a  monster's

combat effectiveness and potentially increase its

challenge rating.

I,

Don't worry if the damage output isn't matching up

with the expected challenge rating for the monster.

Other factors can affect a monster's cha llenge rating,

as will be discussed in later steps, and you can always

adjust a  monster's damage output later on.

Some monsters use natural weapons, such as claws

or tail spikes. Others wield manufactured weapons.

If a monster has natural weapons, you decide how

much damage it deals with those attacks, as well as the

type of damage. See the Monster Manual for examples.

If a monster wields a manufactured weapon, it deals

damage appropriate to the weapon. For example, a

greataxe in the hands of a Medium monster deals ld12

slashing damage plus the monster's Strength modifier,

as is normal for that weapon.

Big monsters typically wield oversized weapons that

deal extra dice of damage on a hit. Double the weapon

dice if the creature is Large, triple the weapon dice if it's

Huge, and quadruple the weapon dice if it's Gargantuan.

For example, a Huge giant wielding an appropriately

sized greataxe deals 3dl2 slashing damage (plus its

Strength bonus), instead of the normalldl2 .

A creature has disadvantage on attack rolls with a

weapon that is sized for a larger attacker. You can rule

that a weapon sized for an attacker two or more sizes

larger is too big for the creature to use at all.

Overall Damage Output. To determine a monster's

overall damage output, take the average damage it

deals with each of its attacks in a round and add them

together. If a monster has different attack options, use

the monster's most effective attacks to determine its

damage output. For example, a fire giant can make two

greatsword attacks or one rock attack in a round. The

greatsword attacks deal more damage, so that attack

routine determines the fire giant's damage output.

If a monster's damage output varies from round to

round, calculate its damage output each round for  the

first three rounds of combat, and take the average.

For example, a young white dragon has a multiattack

routine (one bite attack and two claw attacks) that deals

an average of 37 damage each round, as well as a breath

weapon that deals 45 damage, or 90 if it hits two targets

(and it probably will).  In the first three rounds of combat,

the dragon will probably get to  use its breath weapon

once and its multiattack routine twice, so its average

damage output for the first three rounds would be (90 +

37 + 37) + 3, or 54 damage (rounded down).

When calculating a monster's damage output, also

account for special off-turn damage-dealing features ,

such as auras, reactions, legendary actions, or lair

ATTACK  RIDERS

Many  monsters have attacks that do more than  deal  damage.

Some effects that can  be added to an attack to give  it  a

flavorful  twist include:

Adding damage of a  different type to the attack

Having the monster grapple the target on a  hit

Allowing the  monster to knock the target prone on  a  hit

Imposing a  condition on the target if the attack  hits  and

the target fails  a  saving throw

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP

The Monster Features table list  \arious features that

you can plunder from the Monster j\tfanual.  The table

notes which features increase a monster's effective

Armor Class, hit points, attack bonus. or damage output

for  the purpose of determining its cha llenge rating. (The

features don't actually change the monster's statistics-)

Features that have no effect on a monster's challenge

rating are noted with a dash (-)-

When assigning special traits, actions, or reactions

to a monster, keep in mind that not all monsters need

them. The more you add, the more complex (and harder

to run) the monster becomes.

Innate Spellcasting and Spellcasting. The impact

that the Innate Spellcasting and Spellcasting special

traits have on a monster's challenge rating depends

on the spells that the monster can cast Spells that

deal more damage than the monster's normal attack

routine and spells that increase the monster's AC or

hit points need to be accounted for when determining

the monster's final  challenge rating. See the "Special

Traits" section in the introduction of the Monster

Manual for  more information on these two special traits.

STEP 14.  SPEED

Every monster has a walking speed. (Immobile

monsters have a walking speed of 0 feet) In addition to

its walking speed, a monster might have one or more

other speeds, including a burrowing, climbing, flying,  or

swimming speed.

Flying Monster. Increase the monster's effective

Armor Class by  2 (not its actual A C) if it can fly  and deal

damage at range and if its expected challenge rating

is 10 or lower (higher-level characters have a greater

ability to deal with flying creatures).

STEP 15.  SAVING THROW BONUSES

If you want a monster to be unusually resistant to

certain kinds of effects, you can give it a bonus to saving

throws tied to a particular ability.

A saving throw bonus is  best used to counteract a low

ability score. For example, an undead monster with a

low Wisdom score might need a Wisdom saving throw

bonus to account for  the fact that it's more difficult to

charm, frighten, or turn than its Wisdom would indicate.

A saving throw bonus is equal to  the monster's

proficiency bonus+ the monster's relevant

ability modifier.

A monster with three or more saving throw bonuses

has a significant defensive advantage , so its effective AC

(not its actual AC) should be raised when determining

its challenge rating. If it has three or four bonuses,

increase its effective AC  by 2. If it has five  or more

bonuses, increase its effective AC  by 4.

STEP 16.  FINAL CHALLENGE  RATING

At this point, you have all the statistical information

you need to calculate the monster's final  challenge

rating. This step is identical to step 4 under "Creating

Quick Monster Stats." Calculate the monster's defensive

challenge rating and its offensive challenge rating, then

take the average to get its final challenge rating.

STEP 17.  SKILL BONUSES

If you want a monster to be proficient in a skill, you can

give it a bonus equal to its proficiency bonus on ability

checks related to  that skill. For example, a monster

with sharp senses might have a bonus on Wisdom

(Perception) checks, while a duplicitous monster might

have a bonus on Charisma (Deception) checks.

You  can double the proficiency bonus to account for

heightened mastery. For example, a doppelganger is

so good at deceiving others that its bonus on Charisma

(Deception) checks is equal to double its proficiency

bonus + its Charisma modifier.

Skill bonuses have no bearing on a monster's

challenge rating.

STEP 18.  CONDITION  IMMUNITIES

A monster can be immune to one or more debilitating

conditions, and these immunities have no bearing on

its challenge rating. For descriptions of the various

conditions, see appendix A of the Player's Handbook.

As with damage immunities, condition immunities

should be intuitive and logical. For example, it makes

sense that a stone golem can't be poisoned, since it's a

construct without a nervous system or internal organs.

STEP 19.  SENSES

A monster might have one or more of the following

special senses, which are described in  the Monster

Manual:  blindsight, darkvision, tremorsense, and

truesight. Whether the monster has special senses or

not has no bearing on its challenge rating.

Passive Perception Score. All  monsters have a

passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which is most

often used to determine whether a monster detects

approaching or hidden enemies. A monster's passive

Wisdom (Perception) score is 10 + its Wisdom modifier.

If the monster has proficiency in the Perception skill, its

score is 10 +its Wisdom (Perception) bonus.

STEP 20.  LANGUAGES

Whether a monster can speak a language has no

bearing on its challenge rating.

A monster can master as many spoken languages as

you want, although few monsters know more than one

or two, and many monsters (beasts in particular) have

no spoken language whatsoever. A monster that lacks

the ability to speak might still understand a language.

Telepathy. Whether or not a monster has telepathy

has no bearing on its challenge rating. For more

information on telepathy, see the Monster Manual.

NPC  STAT BLOCKS

Appendix B of the Monster Manual contains stat blocks

for common NPC archetypes such as bandits and

guards, as well as tips for customizing them. Those tips

include adding racial traits from the Player's Handbook,

equipping NPCs with magic items, and swapping armor,

weapons, and spells.

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP

If you want to take an NPC stat block and adapt it for

a specific monster race, apply the ability modifiers and

add the features listed in the NPC Features table. If the

NPC's AC,  hit points, attack bonus , or damage changes,

recalculate its challenge rating.

You  can create an NPC stat block (similar to the ones

in  the Monster Manual) as you would a monster stat

block, as discussed in the previous section.

You  can build the NPC as you would a player

character,  as discussed in the Player's Handbook.

CREATING NPCs FROM  SCRATCH

If you need completely new statistics for an NPC, you

have two options:

If you decide to build an NPC the same way you build

a player character, you can skip choosing a background

and instead pick two skill proficiencies for the NPC.

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP

The NPC Features table summarizes the ability

modifiers and features of variou  nonh uman races, as

well as various creatures from the Monster Manual with

a challenge rating lower than 1. Apply these modifiers

and add these features to  the  P Cs stat block, then

determine the NPC's challenge rating just as you would

for a monster. Features that can affect a  monster's

challenge rating are listed in the Monster Features table.

The NPC's proficiency bonus is determined by its level,

just like a character, rather than by its challenge rating.

If the monster you want to  use isn't listed on the table,

use the process described below under "Monsters

with Classes."

MONSTERS WITH  CLASSES

You can use the rules in chapter 3 of the Player's

Handbook to give class levels to a monster. For example,

you can turn an ordinary werewolf into a werewolf with

four levels of the barbarian class (such a monster would

be expressed as "Werewolf, 4th-level barbarian").

Start with the monster's stat block. The monster gains

all  the class features for every class level you add, with

the following exceptions:

The monster doesn't gain the starting equipment of

the added class.

For each class level you add, the monster gains one

Hit Die of its normal type (based on its size), ignoring

the class's Hit Die progression.

The monster's proficiency bonus is based on its

challenge rating, not its class levels.

Once you finish adding class levels to a monster,

feel  free to  tweak its ability scores as you see fit  (for

example, raising the monster's Intelligence score so

that the monster is a more effective wizard), and make

whatever other adjustments are needed. You'll  need

to recalculate its challenge rating as though you had

designed the monster from scratch.

Depending on the monster and the number of class

levels you add to it, its challenge rating might change

very little or increase dramatically. For example, a

werewolf that gains four barbarian levels is a much

greater threat than it was before. In contrast, the hit

points, spells, and other class features that an ancient

red dragon gains from five  levels of wizard don't

increase its challenge rating.

CREATING A  SPELL

When creating a new spell, use existing spells as

guidelines. Here are some things to consider:

If a spell is so good that a caster would want to use it

all the time, it might be too powerful for its level.

A long duration or large area can make up for a lesser

effect, depending on the spell.

Avoid spells that have very limited use, such as one

that works only against good dragons. Though such

a spell could exist in the world, few characters will

bother to learn or prepare it  unless they know in

advance that doing so will be worthwhile.

Make sure the spell fits with the identity of the class.

Wizards and sorcerers don"t typically have access to

healing spells, for example, and adding a healing spell

to the wizard class list would step on the cleric's turf.

I ,

SPELL DAMAGE

----------------------------

For any spell that deals damage, use the Spell Damage

table to  determine approximately how much damage is

appropriate given the spell's level. The table assumes

the spell deals half damage on a successful saving

throw or a missed attack. If your spell doesn't deal

damage on a successful save, you can increase the

damage by 25 percent.

You  can use different damage dice than the ones

in the table, provided that the average result is about

the same. Doing so can add a little variety to the spell.

For example, you could change a cantrip's damage

from  ldlO (average 5.5) to 2d4 (average 5), reducing

the maximum damage and making an average result

more likely.

HEALING  SPELLS

You can also use the Spell  Damage table to determine

how many hit points a hea ling spell restores. A cantrip

shouldn't offer healing.

CREATING A  MAGIC  ITEM

The magic items in chapter 7, "Treasure,"  are but a few

of the magic treasures that characters can discover

during their adventures. If your players are seasoned

veterans and you want to surprise them, you can either

modify an existing item or come up with something new.

MODIFYING AN  ITEM

The easiest way to invent a new item is to  tweak an

existing one. If a paladin uses a flail  as her main

weapon, you could change a holy avenger so that it's a

flail instead of a sword. You  can turn a ring of the ram

into a wand, or a cloak of protection into a circlet of

protection, all without altering the item's  properties.

Other substitutions are equally easy. An item that

deals damage of one type can easily deal damage of

another type. A flame  tongue sword could deal lightning

damage instead of fire , for example. One capability

can replace another, so a potion of climbing can easily

become a potion of stealth.

You  can also modify an item by fusing it with

properties from another item. For example, you could

combine the effects of a helm of comprehending

languages with those of a helm of telepathy into a

single helmet. This makes the item more powerful

(and probably increases its rarity), but it won't break

your game.

Finally, remember the tools that are provided for

modifying items in chapter 7, "Treasure."  Giving an item

an interesting minor property, a quirk, or sentience can

alter its flavor significantly.

CREATING A  NEW ITEM

If modifying an item doesn't quite do the trick, you can

create one from scratch.  A magic item should either let a

character do something he or she couldn't do before, or

improve the character's ability to do something he or she

can do already. For exa mple, the ring of jumping lets its

wearer jump greater dista nces , thus augmenting what

a character can already do. A ring of the ram , however,

gives a character the ability to deal force damage.

The simpler you r approach. the easier it is for a

character to  use the item in play. Giving the item

charges is fine, especially if it ha  several different

abilities, but simply deciding that an item is always

active or can be used a fixed number of times per day is

easier to rna nage.

POWER LEVEL

If you make an item that lets a cha racter kill whatever

he or she hits with it,  that item will  likely unbalance your

game. On the other hand , an item whose benefit rarely

comes into play isn't much of a rewa rd and probably not

worth doling out as one.

Use the Magic Item Power by Rarity table as a guide

to help you determine how powerful an item should be,

based on  its rarity.

Maximum Spell Level. This column of the table

indicates the highest-level spell effect the item should

confer, in  the form of a once-per-day or similarly limited

property. For example, a common item might confer

the benefit of a 1st-level spell once per day (or just once,

if it's consumable). A rare, very rare, or legendary item

might allow its possessor to cast a lower-level spell

more frequently.

Maximum Bonus. If an item delivers a static bonus

to AC, attack rolls, saving throws, or ability checks, this

column suggests an appropriate bonus based on the

item's rarity.

ATTUNEMENT

Decide whether the item requires a character to be

attuned to it to  use its properties. Use these rules of

thumb to  help you decide:

If having all the characters in a party pass an item

around to gain its lasting benefits would be disruptive,

the item should require attunement.

If the item grants a bonus that other items also

grant, it's a good idea to  require attunement so that

characters don't try to collect too many of those items.

CREATING NEW

CHARACTER OPTIONS

If the options for  player characters in the Player's

Handbook don't meet all the needs of your campaign,

consult the following sections for advice on creating

new race, class, and background options.

CREATING A  RACE  OR SUBRACE ----

This section teaches you how to modify existing races,

as well as create new ones. The most important step in

customizing or designing races for your campaign is

to start with the story behind the race or subrace you

wish to create. Having a firm idea of a  race's story in

your campaign will help you  make decisions during the

creation process. Ask yourself several questions:

Why does my campaign need the race to be playable?

What does the race look like?

How would I describe the race's culture?

Where do the members of this race live?

Are there interesting conflicts built into the race's

history and culture that make the race compelling

from a storytelling standpoint?

What is the race's relationship to the other

playable races?

What classes and backgrounds are well suited to

members of the race?

What are the race's signature traits?

In the case of a new subrace, what sets it apart from

the other subraces of the parent race?

Compare the race you  have in  mind with the other

race options available to players, to make sure that the

new race doesn't pale in comparison to the existing

options (which would result in the race being unpopular)

or completely overshadow them (so that players don't

feel  as if the other options are inferior).

When the time comes to design the game elements

of the race, such as its traits, take a look at the game's

existing races and let them inspire you.

CosMETIC ALTERATIONS

A simple way to modify an existing race is to change

its appearance. Changes to a race's appearance need

not affect its game elements. For example, you could

transform halflings into anthropomorphic mice without

changing their racial traits at all.

CULTURAL ALTERATIONS

In your world, elves might be desert nomads instead of

forest dwellers, halflings might live in cloud cities, and

dwarves might be sailors instead of miners. When you

change the culture of a race, you can also make minor

alterations to the race's proficiencies and traits to  reflect

that culture.

For example, imagine that the dwarves of your world

are seafarers and inventors of gunpowder. You  could

add the pistol and musket to the list of weapons that

dwarves are proficient with, and give them proficiency

with waterborne vehicles instead of artisan's tools.

These two small changes tell a different story than

the default assumptions about dwarves in the Player's

Handbook, without changing the power level of the race.

CREATING A  NEW SUBRACE

Creating a new subrace is more involved than making

some minor tweaks to existing racial features, but it

does have the advantage of increasing the diversity of

options for a particular race, rather than replacing some

options with other ones.

The following example walks through the creation of

an elf subrace: the eladrin. This subrace has history in

the D&D multi verse, so you already have some stories to

draw on when building its traits.

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S WORKSHOP

limited use of the misty step spell. Since misty step is

a 2nd-level spell, this ability is potent enough that the

subrace doesn't need additional traits. This leaves us

with the following features for  the eladrin subrace:

Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score

increases by  1.

Elf Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the

longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

Fey Step. You can cast the misty step spell once usin

this trait. You regain the ability to do so when you finish

a short or long rest.

CREATING A  NEW RACE

When creating a race from scratch , begin with th e

story and proceed from there. Compare your creation

to  the other races of your world, and borrow freely

from the traits of other races. As an example, consider

the aasimar, a race similar to the tiefling but with a

celestial heritage.

EXAMPLE  RACE:  AASIMAR

Whereas tieflings have fiendish blood in their veins,

aasimar are the descendants of celestial beings. These

folk generally appear as glorious humans with lustrou

hair, flawless skin, and piercing eyes. Aasimar often

attempt to pass as humans in order to  right wrongs and

defend goodness on the Material Plane without drawin

undue attention to their celestial heritage. They strive  -

to fit  into society, although they usually rise to  the top,

becoming revered leaders and honorable heroes.

You might decide to use the aasimar as a counterpoin

to  the tiefling race. The two races could even be at odd

reflecting some greater conflict between the forces of

good and evil in your campaign.

Here are our basic goals for  the aasimar:

Aasimar should make effective clerics and paladins.

Aasimar should be to celestials and humans what

tieflings are to fiends and humans.

Given that aasimar and tieflings are like two sides of

the same coin, the tiefling makes a good starting point

for coming up with the new race's traits. Since we wam

aasimar to be effective paladins and clerics, it makes

sense to improve their Wisdom and Charisma instead o:

Intelligence and Charisma.

Like tieflings,  aasimar have darkvision. Instead of

resistance to fire damage, we give them resistance

to radiant damage to reflect their celestial nature.

However, radiant damage isn't as common as fire

damage, so we give them resistance to necrotic damage

as well, making them good at facing undead.

The tiefling's Infernal Legacy trait is a good model

for a similar trait to reflect a magical, celestial heritage.

replacing the tiefling's spells with spells of similar leveL

that more closely match the aasimar's celestial ancestrY.

However, the aasimar's expanded resistance might



require limiting this trait to basic utility spells.

Filling in the rema ining details, we end up with th e

following racial traits for  the aasimar:

Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases

by  1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.

ExAMPLE  SuBRACE:  ELADRIN

Creatures of magic with strong ties to nature, eladrin

live in  the twilight realm of the Feywild. Their cities

sometimes cross over to the Material Plane, appearing

briefly in  mountain valleys or deep forest glades before

fading back into the Feywild.

The elf subraces in the Player's Handbook include

an ability score increase, a weapon training feature,

and two or three additional traits. Given the story of

the eladrin and their magical nature, an increase to an

eladrin character's Intelligence is appropriate. There's

no need to alter the basic weapon training shared by

high elves and wood elves.

An  ability that sets the eladrin apart from other elves

is their ability to step through the boundary between the

planes, disappearing for a moment before reappearing

somewhere else. In the game, this is reflected in a

286

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S WORKSHOP

Age. Aasimar mature at the  arne rate as humans but

live a few yea rs  longer.

Alignment. Due to their celestial heritage, aasimar

are often good. However, some aasimar fall  into evil,

rejecting their heritage.

Size. Aasimar are built like well-proportioned

humans. Your size is Medium.

Speed. Your base walking s peed is 30 feet.

Darkvision. Thanks to your celestial heritage, you

have superior vision in da rk and dim conditions. You

can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were

bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You

can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

Celestial Resistance. You have  resistance to necrotic

damage and radiant damage.

Celestial Legacy. You know the light can trip. Once

you reach 3rd level , you can cast the lesser restoration

spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do

so when you finish a long rest. Once you reach 5th level,

you can cast the daylight spell once with this trait as a

3rd-level spell, and you  regain the ability to  do so when

you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting

ability for  these spells.

Languages. You  can speak, read, and write Common

and Celestial.

MODIFYING A  CLASS

The classes in the Player's Handbook capture a wide

range of character archetypes, but your campaign world

might have need of something more. The following

section discusses ways to modify existing classes to

better serve your game's needs.

CHANGING PROFICIENCIES

Changing a class's  proficiencies is a safe and simple way

to  modify a class to  better reflect your world. Swapping

out one skill or tool proficiency for another doesn't make

a character any stronger or weaker, but doing so can

change the flavor of a class in subtle ways.

For example, a prominent guild of rogues in your

world might worship a patron deity, performing secret

missions in that deity's name. To  reflect this cultural

detail, you could add Religion to the list of skills that a

rogue character can choose as a proficiency. You could

even mandate that skill as one of the choices for rogues

who belong to this guild.

You  can also change armor and weapon proficiencies

to reflect certain aspects of your world . For example,

you could decide that the clerics of a particular deity

belong to an order that forbids the accumulation of

material goods, other than magic items useful for their

divine mission. Such clerics carry a staff, but they

are forbidden from wearing armor or using weapons

other than that staff. To reflect this, you could remove

the armor and weapon proficiencies for clerics of this

faith,  making them proficient with the quarterstaff and

nothing else. You could give them a benefit to make up

for the loss of proficiencies- something like the monk's

Unarmored Defense class feature , but presented as a

divine blessing.

CHANGING SPELL LISTS

Modifying a class's spell list usually has little effect on

a character's power but can change the flavor of a class

significantly. In your world , paladins might not swear

their oaths to ideals, but instead swear fealty to powerful

sorcerers. To capture this story concept, you could build

a  new paladin spell list with spells meant to protect

their masters, drawn from the sorcerer or wizard lists.

Suddenly, the paladin feels like a different class.

Be cautious when changing the warlock spell list.

Since warlocks regain their spell slots after a short rest,

they have the potential to  use certain spells more times

in a day than other classes do.

RESTRICTING  CLASS ACCESS

Without changing the way a class functions, you can

root it more firmly in the world by associating the class

with a particular race or culture.

For example, you might decide that bards, sorcerers,

warlocks, and wizards represent the magical traditions

of four different races or cultures. The bardic colleges

might be closed to everyone except elves, dragonborn

might be the only creatures capable of becoming

sorcerers, and all warlocks in your world might be

human. You  could break that down still further: bards

of the College of Lore could be high elves, and bards

of the College of War could be wood elves. Gnomes

discovered the school of illusion, so all wizards who

specialize in that school are gnomes. Different human

cultures produce warlocks with different pacts, and

so on. Similarly, different cleric domains might reflect

entirely separate religions associated with different

races or cultures.

You decide how flexible you want to  be in allowing

a player character to break these restrictions. Can a

half-elf live among the elves and study their bardic

traditions? Can a dwarf stumble into a warlock pact

despite having no connection to a culture that normally

produces warlocks? As always, it's better to  say yes and

use the player's  desire as an opportunity to develop the

character's story and that of your world, rather than

shutting down possibilities.

SUBSTITUTING  CLASS  FEATURES

If one or more features of a given class don't exactly

fit  the theme or tone of your campaign, you can pull

them out of the class and replace them with new

ones. In doing so, you should strive to make sure

that the new options are just as appealing as the

ones you are removing, and that the substitute class

features contribute to the class's effectiveness at social

interaction, exploration, or combat just as well as those

being replaced.

Ultimately, a class exists to help a player express a

particular character concept, and any class feature you

replace is also removing an aspect of that character.

Substituting a class feature should be done only to fit  a

specific need for your campaign, or to appeal to a player

trying to create a specific kind of character (perhaps one

modeled after a character from a novel, TV series, comic

book, or movie).

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP

Once you have the concept for  the class option in

mind , it's time to design the specifics. If you're not sure

where to  begin, look at the existing options and see w  -

class features they provide. It's perfectly acceptable for

two class options to have similar features, and it's al  o

fine  to look at other classes for examples of mechanics

you can draw on for inspiration. As you design each

class feature , ask the following questions:

How does the class feature reinforce the story or

theme of the class option?

Is there an existing feature that can be used

as a model?

How does the new class feature compare to other

features of the same level?

VARIANT:  SPELL POINTS

One way to modify how a class feels is to  change how _

uses its spells. With this variant system, a character \

has the Spellcasting feature uses spell points instead

spell slots to fuel spells. Spell points give a caster more

flexibility,  at the cost of greater complexity.

In this variant, each spell has a point cost based on - ~

level. The Spell Point Cost table summarizes the cosr  -

spell points of slots from  1st to 9th level.  Cantrips don

require slots and therefore don't require spell points.

Instead of gaining a number of spell slots to cast you;

spells from the Spellcasting feature, you  gain a pool

of spell points instead. You  expend a number of spell

points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then us~

that slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell po-

total to less than 0,  and you regain all spent spell poin

when you finish a long rest.

Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxi ng

cast. You can use spell points to create one slot of each

level of 6th or higher. You  can't create another slot of   -

same level until you finish a long rest.

The number of spell points you have to spend is ba

on your level as a spellcaster, as shown in the Spell

Points by Level table. Your level also determines the

maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though

you might have enough points to create a slot above this

maximum, you can't do so.

The Spell Points by Level table applies to bards,

clerics, druids, sorcerers, and wizards. For a paladin o~

ranger, halve the character's level in that class and the

consult the table. For a fighter (Eidritch Knight) or ro

(Arcane Trickster), divide the character's level in that

class by three.

This system can be applied to monsters that cast

spells using spell slots, but it isn't recommended that

you do so. Tracking spell point expenditures for a

monster can be a hassle.

The first step is to figure out what class feature or

group of class features you're going to  replace. Then

you need to evaluate what each feature provides to  the

class, so that the features you are adding don't make the

class over- or underpowered. Ask yourself the following

questions about a feature you're replacing:

What impact does replacing the feature have on

exploration, social interaction, or combat?

Does replacing the feature affect how long the party

can continue adventuring in a day?

Does the feature consume resources provided

elsewhere in the class?

Does the feature work all the time, or is it regained

after a short rest, a long rest, or some other

length of time?

Armed with answers to these questions, you can start

designing new features that replace the ones you are

removing. It's fine  if the new class features drift closer

to  exploration, social interaction, or combat than the

ones you are replacing, but be wary of going too far.

For example, if you replace an exploration-focused

feature with something purely combat focused , you've

just made that class more powerful in combat, and it

could overshadow the other classes in a way that you

didn't intend.

There's no formula that can tell you how to design

new class features. The best place to start is by looking

at other class features, or at spells, feats , or any other

rules for inspiration. You're almost certainly going to

have some missteps, as features that seem good on the

surface fall  apart in play. That's all right. Everything

you design will need to be playtested. When introducing

new class features, be sure the players using them are

comfortable with the fact that you might need to go back

and make some changes after seeing them in play.,

CREATING NEW CLASS  OPTIONS

Each class has at least one major choice point. Clerics

choose a divine domain, fighters choose a martial

archetype, wizards choose an arcane tradition, and

so forth.  Creating a new option doesn't require you to

remove anything from the class, but any new option

you add should be compared to existing options to

make sure it's no more or less powerful , yet remains

distinctive in flavor.  Like anything in class design, be

prepared to  playtest your ideas and make changes if

things aren't playing out the way you want them to.

CREATING A  BACKGROUND

A well-crafted background can help a player create a

character that feels like an exciting addition to your

campaign. It helps define the character's place in the

world, rather than what a character is in terms of game

mechanics.

Instead of focusing on a generic character

background, such as merchant or wanderer, think

about the factions , organizations, and cultures of

your campaign and how they might be leveraged to

create flavorful  backgrounds for player characters. For

example, you could create an acolyte of Candlekeep

background that is functionally similar to a sage

background, but which ties a character more closely to a

place and organization in your world.

A character with the acolyte of Candlekeep

background probably has friends among the

Avowed-the monks who maintain the great library

at Candlekeep. The character can enter the library

and consult its lore freely,  while others must donate

a rare or valuable tome of knowledge before they are

allowed entry. Candlekeep's enemies are the character's

enemies , and its allies, the character's friends. Acolytes

of Candlekeep are generally regarded as learned sages

and protectors of knowledge. It's possible to  envision

ma ny interesting interactions as NPCs discover the

character's background and approach the character in

search of assistance.

To  create your own background, follow these steps.

STEP 1.  ROOT lT IN YOUR WORLD

To ground a new background in your campaign's

setting, determine what element of yo ur campaign the

background is tied to:  a faction. an organization,  a trade,

a person, an event, or a location.

STEP 2.  SUGGEST P E RSO NA L  CHARACTERISTICS

Create tables of suggested characteristics-personality

traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws-that fit  the background ,

or plunder entries from the tables presented in the

Player's Handbook.  Even if your players don't use

the tables, this step helps you paint a picture of the

background's place in your world. The tables need not

be extensive; two or three entries per table are enough.

STEP 3.  ASSIGN  PROFICIENCIES  OR LANGUAGES

Choose two skill proficiencies and two tool proficiencies

for the background. You can replace tool proficiencies

with languages on a one-for-one basis.

STEP 4'. INCLUDE  STARTING  EQUIPMENT

Make sure your background offers a package of starting

equipment. In addition to a small amount of money that

a character can use to buy adventuring gear, the starting

equipment should include items that a character would

have acquired prior to  becoming an adventurer, as well

as one or two items unique to the background.

For example, starting equipment for a character with

the acolyte of Candlekeep background might include a

set of traveler's clothes, a scholar's robe, five  candles,

a tinderbox, an empty scroll case engraved with the

symbol of Candlekeep, and a belt pouch containing 10

gp. The scroll case might be a gift given to an acolyte of

Candlekeep who embarks on a life of adventure. At your

discretion, it might also contain a useful map.

STEP  5.  SETTLE  ON A  BACKGROUND  FEATURE

Choose an existing background feature or create a new

one, as you prefer. If you choose an existing feature, add

or tweak a few  details to make it unique.

For example, the acolyte of Candlekeep background

might have the Researcher feature of the sage (as

presented in the Player's Handbook), with the additional

benefit that the character is allowed to enter Candlekeep

without paying the normal cost.

A background feature should avoid strict game

benefits, such as a bonus to an ability check or an attack

roll. Instead, the feature should open up new options for

roleplaying, exploring, and otherwise interacting with

the world.

For example, the sage's Researcher feature is

designed to send the character on adventures. It doesn't

provide information or an automatic success for a check.

Instead, if a character with the sage background fails

to recall information, he or she instead knows where to

learn it. This might be a pointer to  another sage or to  a

library long lost within an ancient tomb.

The best background features give characters

a reason to strike out on quests, to make contact

with NPCs, and to develop bonds to the setting

you've devised.

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP

APPENDIX A:  RANDOM  DUNGEONS

HIS APPENDIX  HELPS YOU  QUICKLY GENERATE

a dungeon. The tables work in an iterative

manner. First, roll a starting area, then roll to

determine the passages and doors found in

that area. One you have initial passages and

doors, determine the location and nature of

subsequent passages, doors, chambers, stairs, and so

on- each of them generated by rolls on different tables.

Following these instructions can lead to sprawling

complexes that more than fill  a single sheet of graph

paper. If you want to constrain the dungeon , establish

limits ahead of time on  how far it can grow.

The most obvious limit to a dungeon's size is the

graph paper it's drawn on. If a feature would exceed

the boundaries of the page, curtail it. A corridor might

turn or come to a dead end at the map's edge, or you can

make a chamber smaller to fit  the available space.

Alternatively, you can decide that passages leading off

the edge of the map are additional dungeon entrances.

Stairs, shafts, and other features that would normally

lead to levels you don't plan to map can serve a

similar purpose.

STARTING AREA

The Starting Area table produces a chamber or a set of

corridors at the entrance to your dungeon. When rolling

for a random starting area, pick one of the doors or

passages leading into the starting area as the entrance

to the dungeon as a whole.

Once you've selected the entrance, roll  on the

appropriate table for each passage or door leading away

from the starting area. Passages each extend 10 feet

beyond the starting area. After that point, check on the

Passage table for each passage to determine what lies

beyond. Use the Beyond a Door table to  determine what

lies behind doors and secret doors.

PASSAGES

When generating passages and corridors, roll on the

branches of any open passage on the map until you

Whenever you create a new passage, roll to determi ne

its width. If the passage branches from another passage

roll a d12 on the Passage Width table. If it comes from

a chamber, roll a d20 on that table,  but the width of the

passage must be at least 5 feet smaller than the longest

dimension of the chamber.

CONNECTING AREAS

When your map is done, consider adding doors between

chambers and passages that are next to each other but

otherwise not connected. Such doors create more paths

through the dungeon and expand players' options.

If your dungeon consists of more than one level, be

sure that any stairs, pits, and other vertical passages

line up between levels. If you're using graph paper,

lay a  new page on top of your existing map, mark the

locations of stairs and other features shared by the two

levels, and begin mapping the new level.

STOCKING A  DUNGEON

Creating a map for your dungeon is only half the fun.

Once you have the layout, you need to decide what

challenges and rewards are to be found in the dungeon's

passages and chambers. Any reasonably large space

should be stocked with interesting sights, sounds,

objects, and creatures.

You  don't need to  have every last detail of your

dungeon plotted out. You  can get by with nothing more

than a list of monsters, a list of treasures, and a list of

one or two key elements for each dungeon area.

CHAMBER PURPOSE

A room's purpose can help determine its furnishings

and other contents.

For each chamber on your dungeon map, establish its

purpose or use the tables below to generate ideas. Each

type of dungeon described in the "Dungeon Purpose"

APPENDIX A  I RANDOM  DUNGEONS

section of chapter 5,  "Adventure Environments," has its

own table featuring chambers geared to the dungeon's

purpose. For example, if you're building a tomb, use the

Dungeon: Tomb table to help you determine the purpose

of each chamber. These dungeon-specific tables are

followed  by the General Dungeon Chambers table,

which you can use if your dungeon isn't an exact fit  for

one of the standard types of dungeon or if you want to

mix things up.

Relying on random rolls to stock an entire dungeon

can lead to incongruous results. A tiny room might end

up being identified as a temple, while the huge chamber

next door serves as storage. It can be fun  to try to  make

sense of such strange design ideas, but make changes

as you see fit.  You can set aside a few key rooms and

create specific contents for  them.

CHAMBER  CONTENTS

Once you  have a sense of the purpose of the various

dungeon chambers, you can think about the contents

of those areas. The Dungeon Chamber Contents table

allows you to randomly roll contents for a chamber, or

you can choose contents for specific areas. If you choose

contents , be sure to include an interesting, colorful

assortment of things. In addition to the contents shown

on this table, refer to  "Dungeon Dressing" later in this

appendix for additional items and elements to fill  rooms.

In the Dungeon Chamber Contents table, a "dominant

inhabitant" is a creature that controls an area. Pets

and allied creatures are subservient to the dominant

inhabitant. "Random creatures" are scavengers or

nuisances, usually lone monsters or small groups

passing through the area. They include such creatures

as carrion crawlers, dire rats, gelatinous cubes, and rust

monsters. See chapter 3, "Creating Adventures," for

more information on random encounters.

MONSTERS  AND  MOTIVATIONS

See chapter 3, "Creating Adventures," for guidance on

creating encounters with monsters. To foster variety

and suspense, be sure to include encounters of varying

difficulty.

A powerful creature encountered early in  the dungeon

sets an exciting tone and forces the adventurers to

rely on their wits. For example, an ancient red dragon

APPENDIX  A  I RANDOM  DUNGEONS

might slumber on the first level of a dungeon, a pall of

smoke and the sound of its heavy breathing filling the

chambers near its lair. Clever characters will do their

utmost to avoid the dragon, even as the party's brave

thief makes off with a few coins from  its hoard.

Not all monsters are automatically hostile. When

placing monsters in your dungeon, consider their

relationships to  nearby creatures and their attitudes

toward adventurers. Characters might be able to

appease a hungry beast by offering it food,  and smarter

creatures have complex motivations. The Monster

Motivation table lets you use a monster's goals to define

its presence in the dungeon.

For large groups of monsters encountered across

multiple chambers, motivation could apply to the entire

group, or each subgroup could have conflicting goals.

RANDOM  DUNGEON  HAZARDS

Hazards are rarely found in inhabited areas, because

monsters either clear them away or avoid them.

Shriekers and violet fungi are described in  the

Monster Manual.  The other hazards on the table are

described in chapter 5,  "Adventure Environments."

RANDOM  OBSTACLES

Obstacles block progress through the dungeon. In some

cases, what adventurers consider an obstacle is an

easy path for the dungeon's  inhabitants. For example,

a flooded chamber is a barrier to many characters but

easily navigated by water-breathing creatures.

Obstacles can affect more than one room. A chasm

might run through several passages and chambers,

or send cracks through the stonework in a wider area

around it.  An area of battering winds that emanates

from a magic altar could stir the air less dangerously for

hundreds of feet in all directions.

RANDOM  TRAPS

If you need a trap quickly or want to drop random

traps into a dungeon, use the sample  traps presented

in  chapter 5,  "Adventure Environments" or the tables

below. If you use the tables, start with the Trap Effects

and Trap Trigger tables to  decide the type of trap,

then use the Trap Damage S everity tables to decide

how deadly it should be. For more information on trap

damage severity, see chapter 5.

RANDOM  TRICKS

Tricks are quirkier and less deadly than traps. Some

are effects left  behind by the dungeon's creators, while

others might be manifestations of the strange magical

energy suffusing the dungeon.

The following tables allow you to generate random

tricks. Roll first to  determine an object that the trick

is placed on, then roll to determine the nature of the

trick. Some tricks are permanent effects that can't be

dispelled; others are temporary or can be neutralized

with a dispel magic spell. You decide which is which.

APPENDIX A  I RANDOM  DUNGEONS

RANDOM TREASURES

Use the tables and guidelines in chapter 7,  "Treasure" to

determine the treasure in each area of your dungeon.

EMPTY ROOMS

An empty room can be a godsend for characters who

need a safe place to take a short rest. Characters can

also barricade themselves there and take a long rest.

Sometimes such a room isn't as empty as it appears. If

the characters search a room carefully, you can reward

them with a secret compartment containing a journal

belonging to  a previous inhabitant, a map leading to

another dungeon, or some other discovery.

DUNGEON  DRESSING

The tables in this section provide miscellaneous

items and points of interest that can be placed in your

dungeon. Dungeon dressing can help establish the

atmosphere of a dungeon, give clues about its creators

a nd history, provide the basis for tricks and traps, or

encourage exploration.

To  generate dungeon dressing at random, roll once on

each of the following tables: Noises , Air, and Odors. Roll

as often as you like on the other tables in this section, or

choose appropriate furnishings for the area.
