USING THIS BOOK

Tasha's Cauldron of Everything offers a host of new

options for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, and our journey

through those options is accompanied by the notes

of the wizard Tasha. Creator of the spell Tasha's hid

eous laughter, Tasha's life is one of the most storied

in the D&D multiverse. Raised by Baba Yaga, the

Mother of Witches herself, Tasha adventured across

the world of Greyhawk and became the friend and

sometimes enemy of other famous adventurers,

like Mordenkainen. In time, she ruled as the Witch

Queen and later changed her name to Iggwilv-a

figure of legend who is whispered about, feared,

and admired.

Written for players and Dungeon Masters alike,

this book offers options to enhance characters and

campaigns in any D&D world, whether you're adven

turing in Greyhawk, another official D&D setting, or

a world of your own creation.

WHAT YOU'LL FIND WITHIN

Chapter 1 brims with new features and subclasses

for the classes in the Player's Handbook, and it

presents the artificer class, a master of magical

invention. The chapter also offers feats for groups

that use them.

Chapter 2 contains patrons who can become one of

the driving forces behind your group's adventures.

Chapter 3 sparkles with new magical options, in

cluding spells, magical spellbooks, artifacts, and

magic-infused tattoos-available for both player

characters and monsters to use.

Chapter 4 holds various rules that a DM may incor

porate into a campaign, including rules on side

kicks who level up with the player characters and

on supernatural environments. The chapter ends

with a collection of puzzles ready to be deployed in

any adventure that the DM would like to spice up

with some puzzling.

IT'S ALL OPTIONAL

Everything in this book is optional. Each group,

guided by the DM, decides which of these options,

if any, to incorporate into a campaign. You can use

some, all, or none of them. We encourage you to

choose the ones that fit best with your campaign's

story and with your group's style of play.

Whatever options you choose to use, this book re

lies on the rules in the Player's Handbook, Monster

Manual, and Dungeon Master's Guide, and it can be

paired with the options in Xanathar's Guide to Ev

erything and other D&D books.

UNEARTHED ARCANA

Much of the material in this book originally appeared

in Unearthed Arcana, a series of online articles we

publish to explore rules that might officially become

part of the game. Some Unearthed Arcana offerings

don't end up resonating with fans and are set aside.

The Unearthed Arcana material that inspired the op

tions in the following chapters was well received and,

thanks to feedback from thousands of D&D fans, has

been refined into the official forms presented here.

TEN RULES TO REMEMBER

1. THE DM ADJUDICATES THE RULES

The rules of D&D cover many of the twists and

turns that come up in play, but the possibilities are

so vast that the rules can't cover everything. When

you encounter something that the rules don't cover

or if you're unsure how to interpret a rule, the DM

decides how to proceed, aiming for a course that

brings the most enjoyment to your whole group.

2. EXCEPTIONS SUPERSEDE GENERAL RULES

General rules govern each part of the game. For ex

ample, the combat rules tell you that melee weapon

attacks use Strength and ranged weapon attacks

use Dexterity. That's a general rule, and a general

rule is in effect as long as something in the game

doesn't explicitly say otherwise.

The game also includes elements-class features,

spells, magic items, monster abilities, and the like

that sometimes contradict a general rule. When an

exception and a general rule disagree, the exception

wins. For example, if a feature says you can make

melee weapon attacks using your Charisma, you

can do so, even though that statement disagrees

with the general rule.

3. ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE

Even if more than one factor gives you advantage or

disadvantage on a roll, you have it only once, and if

you have advantage and disadvantage on the same

roll, they cancel each other.

4. REACTION TIMING

Certain game features let you take a special action,

called a reaction, in response to an event. Making

opportunity attacks and casting the shield spell are

two typical uses of reactions. If you're unsure when

a reaction occurs in relation to its trigger, here's

the rule: the reaction happens after its trigger, un

less the description of the reaction explicitly says

otherwise. Once you take a reaction, you can't take

another one until the start of your next turn.

6. BONUS ACTION SPELLS

If you want to cast a spell that has a casting time of

1 bonus action, remember that you can't cast any

other spells before or after it on the same turn, ex

cept for cantrips with a casting time of 1  action.

7.  CONCENTRATION

As soon as you start casting a spell or using a spe

cial ability that requires concentration, your concen

tration on another effect ends instantly.

8. TEMPORARY HIT POINTS

Temporary hit points aren't cumulative. If you have

temporary hit points and receive more of them, you

don't add them together, unless a game feature says

you can. Instead, you decide which temporary hit

points to keep.

TAIH~ _J

5. PROFICIENCY BONUS

If your proficiency bonus applies to a roll, you can

add the bonus only once to the roll, even if multiple

things in the game say your bonus applies. More

over, if more than one thing tells you to double or

halve your bonus, you double it only once or halve

it only once before applying it. Whether multiplied,

divided, or left at its normal value, the bonus can be

used only once per roll.

9. ROUND DOWN

Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the

game, round down if you end up with a fraction,

even if the fraction is one-half or greater.

10. HAVE FUN

You don't need to know every rule to enjoy D&D,

and each group has its own style different ways it

likes to tell stories and to use the rules. Embrace

what your group enjoys most. In short, follow

your bliss!

CHAPTER I

CHARACTER OPTIONS

HEN YOU MAKE YOUR D&D CHARACTER,

you have an array of options in the

Player's Handbook to create the sort of

adventurer you want. This chapter adds

to those options, making it possible to realize even

more character concepts. If you combine these op

tions with those in Xanathar's Guide to Everything,

the possibilities for your characters become vast.

Here are the options featured in this chapter:

If you'd like your character to follow their own

path, you may ignore your Ability Score Increase

trait and assign ability score increases tailored to

your character. Here's how to do it: take any ability

score increase you gain in your race or subrace

and apply it to an ability score of your choice. If you

gain more than one increase, you can't apply those

increases to the same ability score, and you can't

increase a score above 20.

A way to customize your character's origin by

changing some of your racial traits

Guidance on changing your subclass

The artificer class, a master of magical invention

Class features and subclasses for every class in

the Player's Handbook

Feats for anyone who uses that optional rule

CUSTOMIZING YOUR ORIGIN

At 1st level, you choose various aspects of your

character, including ability scores, race, class, and

background. Together these elements help paint a

picture of your character's origin and give you the

ability to create many different types of characters.

Despite that versatility, a typical character race in

D&D includes little or no choice-a lack that can

make it difficult to realize certain character con

cepts. The following subsections address that lack

by adding choice to your character's race, allowing

you to customize your ability scores, languages,

and certain proficiencies to fit the origin you have

in mind for your character. Character race in the

game represents your character's fantasy species,

combined with certain cultural assumptions. The

following options step outside those assumptions to

pave the way for truly unique characters.

ABILITY SCORE INCREASES

Whatever D&D race you choose for your character,

you get a trait called Ability Score Increase. This

increase reflects an archetypal bit of excellence in

the adventurers of this kind in D&D's past. For ex

ample, if you're a dwarf, your Constitution increases

by 2, because dwarf heroes in D&D are often excep

tionally tough. This increase doesn't apply to every

dwarf, just to dwarf adventurers, and it exists to

reinforce an archetype. That reinforcement is appro

priate if you want to lean into the archetype, but it's

unhelpful if your character doesn't conform to the

archetype.

For example, if the Ability Score Increase trait of

your race or subrace increases your Constitution by

2 and your Wisdom by 1, you could instead increase

your Intelligence by 2 and your Charisma by 1.

LANGUAGES

Your character's race includes languages that your

character is assumed to know, usually Common

and the language of your ancestors. For example, a

halfling adventurer is assumed to know Common

and Halfling. Here's the thing: D&D adventurers are

extraordinary, and your character might have grown

up speaking languages different from the ones in

your Languages trait.

To customize the languages you know, you may

replace each language in your Languages trait with

a language from the following list: Abyssal, Celes

tial, Common, Deep Speech, Draconic, Dwarvish,

Elvish, Giant, Gnomish, Goblin, Halfling, Infernal,

Ore, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon.

Your DM may add or remove languages from that

list, depending on what languages are appropriate

for your campaign.

PROFICIENCIES

Some races and subraces grant proficiencies. These

proficiencies are usually cultural, and your charac

ter might not have any connection with the culture

in question or might have pursued different training.

You can replace each of those proficiencies with a

different one of your choice, following the restric

tions on the Proficiency Swaps table.

CHAPTER 1  I  CHARACTER OPTIONS

CUSTO M  LIN EAG E

Instead of choosing one of the game's races for your

character at l st level, you can use the following traits

to represent your character's lineage, giving you full

control over how your character's origin shaped them:

Creature Type. You are a humanoid. You determine

your appearance and whether you resemble any

of your kin.

Size. You are Small or Medium (your choice).

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Ability Score Increase. One ability score of your choice

increases by 2.

Feat. You gain one feat of your choice for which

you qualify.

Variable Trait. You gain one of the following options of

your choice:  (a) darkvision with a range of 60 feet or

(b) proficiency in one skill of your choice.

Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common

and one other language that you and your DM agree

is appropriate for your character.

CHANGING YOUR SUBCLASS

Each character class involves the choice of a sub

class at 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. A subclass represents

an area of specialization and offers different class

features as you level up. With your DM's approval,

you can change your subclass when you would nor

mally gain a new subclass feature. If you decide to

make this change, choose another subclass that be

longs to your class and replace all your old subclass

features with the features of the new subclass that

are for your new level and lower.

TRAINING TIME

To change your subclass, your DM might require

you to spend time devoted to the transition, as

you study the ways of the new specialization. This

transition requires a number of days equal to twice

your new level in the class; a higher level represents

more to learn.

For example, high elf adventurers have proficiency

The DM might also require an expenditure of

with longswords, which are martial weapons. Con

sulting the Proficiency Swaps table, we see that

your high elf can swap that proficiency for profi

ciency with another weapon or a tool. Your elf might

be a musician, who chooses proficiency with a

musical instrument-a type of tool-instead of with

longswords. Similarly,  elves start with proficiency

in the Perception skill. Your elf might not have the

keen senses associated with your kin and could take

proficiency in a different skill, such as Performance.

The "Equipment" chapter of the Player's Hand

book includes weapons and tools suitable for these

swaps, and your DM might allow additional options.

PERSONALITY

The description of a race might suggest various

things about the behavior and personality of that

people's archetypal adventurers. You may ignore

those suggestions, whether they're about alignment,

moods, interests, or any other personality trait. Your

character's personality and behavior are entirely

yours to determine.

CHANGING A SKILL

Sometimes you pick a skill proficiency that ends up

not being very useful in the campaign or that no lon

ger fits your character's story. In those cases, talk to

your DM about replacing that skill proficiency with

another skill proficiency offered by your class at 1st

level. A convenient time for such a change is when

you reach a level that grants you the Ability Score

Increase feature, representing that your character

has spent a level or two studying the new skill and

letting the old one atrophy.

money to pay for training, magical reagents, or other

goods needed for the transition. The cost is typically

100 gp times your new level. This cost might be

accompanied by a quest of some sort. For example,

a sorcerer who wants to adopt a Draconic Bloodline

could be required to receive blood, a blessing, or

both from an ancient dragon.

If you return to a subclass that you previously

held, you forgo the gold cost, and the time required

for the transition is halved.

SUDDEN CHANGE

Sometimes a character undergoes a dramatic

transformation in their beliefs and abilities. When

a character experiences a profound self-realization

or faces an entity or a place of overwhelming power,

beauty,  or terror, the DM might allow an immediate

subclass change. Here are a few examples:

An Oath of Devotion paladin failed to stop a de

monic horde from ravaging her homeland. After

spending a night in sorrowful prayer, she rises the

next morning with the features of the Oath of Ven

geance, ready to hunt down the horde.

A wizard lies down for a nap beneath an oak tree

whose roots reach into the Feywild. In his dreams,

he faces visions of multiple possible futures. When

he awakens, his subclass features have been re

placed by those of the School of Divination.

A cleric of the War Domain has spent years in

conflict with the enemies of her temple. But one

day, she wanders into a sun-dappled glade, where

her god once shed a tear of mercy over the world's

suffering. Drinking from the glade's brook, the

CHAPTER 1  I  CHARACTER OPTIONS

In the Forgotten Realms, the island of Lantan is

home to many artificers, and in the world of Dragon

lance, tinker gnomes are often members of this

class. The strange technologies in the Barrier Peaks

of the world of Greyhawk have inspired some folk

to walk the path of the artificer, and in Mystara, var

ious nations employ artificers to keep airships and

other wondrous devices operational.

Artificers in the City of Sigil share discoveries

from throughout the multiverse, and from there,

the gnome artificer Vi runs a cosmos-spanning

business that hires adventurers to fix problems that

others deem unfixable. In Vi's home world, Eberron,

magic is harnessed as a form of science and de

ployed throughout society, largely as a result of the

wondrous ingenuity of artificers.

CREATING AN ARTIFICER

Artificers ivet uttiq-edqe problews, the try to

solve thew-- loudly ad o[te with collateral doaqe.

TASHA

To create an artificer, consult the following subsec

tions, which give you hit points, proficiencies, and

starting equipment. Then look at the Artificer table

to see which features you get at each level. The de

scriptions of those features appear in the "Artificer

Features" section.

ARTIFICER

Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and

magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in ob

jects. They see magic as a complex system waiting

to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells

and inventions. You can find everything you need to

play one of these inventors in the next few sections.

Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their

arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use

alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, callig

rapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tin

ker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of

artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and

few other characters can produce the right tool for a

job as well as an artificer.

ARTIFICERS IN MANY WORLDS

Throughout the D&D multiverse, artificers create

inventions and magic items of peace and war. Many

lives have been brightened or saved because of the

work of kind artificers, but countless lives have

also been lost because of the mass destruction un

leashed by certain artificers' creations.

QUICK BUILD

You can make an artificer quickly by following these

suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in

Intelligence, followed by Constitution or Dexterity.

Second, choose the guild artisan background.

HIT POINTS

Hit Dice: ld8 per artificer level

Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitu

tion modifier

Hit Points at Higher Levels: ld8 (or 5) + your Con-

stitution modifier per artificer level after 1st

PROFICIENCIES

Armor: Light armor,  medium armor, shields

Weapons: Simple weapons

Tools: Thieves' tools, tinker's tools, one type of arti

san's tools of your choice

Saving Throws: Constitution, Intelligence

Skills: Choose two from Arcana, History, In

vestigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception,

Sleight of Hand

The secrets of gunpowder weapons have been dis

covered in various corners of the D&D multiverse.

If your Dungeon Master uses the rules on firearms

in the Dungeon Master's Guide and your artificer

has been exposed to the operation of such weapons,

your artificer is proficient with them.

STARTING EQUIPMENT

You start with the following equipment, in addition

to the equipment granted by your background:

any two simple weapons of your choice

a light crossbow and 20 bolts

your choice of studded leather armor or scale mail

thieves' tools and a dungeoneer's pack

If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the

items offered by your background, you start with

5d4 x 10 gp to buy your equipment.

MULTICLASSING AND THE ARTIFICER

If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in

the Player's Handbook,  here's what you need to know if

you choose artificer as one of your-classes.

Ability Score Minimum. As a multiclass character,

you must have at least an Intelligence score of 13 to

take a level  in this class, or to take a level  in another

class if you are already an artificer.

Proficiencies Gained. If artificer isn't your initial

class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you

take your first level as an artificer: light armor, medium

armor,  shields, thieves' tools, tinker's tools.

Spell Slots. Add half your levels (rounded up) in

the artificer class to the appropriate levels from other

classes to determine your available spell slots.

10

CHAPTER l I  CHARACTER OPTIONS

CLASS FEATURES

As an artificer, you gain the following class features,

which are summarized in the Artificer table.

MAGICAL TINKERING

Ist-level artificer feature

You've learned how to invest a spark of magic into

mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have

thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand. You then

touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and

give it one of the following magical properties of

your choice:

The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and

dim light for an additional 5 feet.

Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a

recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet

away. You utter the message when you bestow this

property on the object, and the recording can be

no more than 6 seconds long.

The object continuously emits your choice of an

odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping,

or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceiv

able up to 10 feet away.

A static visual effect appears on one of the object's

surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25

words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of

these elements, as you like.

The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an

action, you can touch the object and end the prop

erty early.

You can bestow magic on multiple objects,

touching one object each time you use this feature,

though a single object can only bear one property

at a time. The maximum number of objects you

can affect with this feature at one time is equal to

your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one ob

ject). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest

property immediately ends, and then the new prop

erty applies.

SPELLCASTING

1st-level artificer feature

You've studied the workings of magic and how to

cast spells, channeling the magic through objects.

To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells

in a conventional way; you appear to produce

wonders from mundane items and outlandish

inventions.

TOOLS REQUIRED

You produce your artificer spell effects through your

tools. You must have a spellcasting focus-specifi

cally thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool-in

hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting

feature (meaning the spell has an "M" component

THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE

As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your

spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about

how you're using a tool. For example, if you cast cure

wounds using alchemist's supplies, you could be

quickly producing a salve.  If you cast it using tinker's

tools, you might have a miniature mechanical  spider

that binds wounds. The effect of the spell is the same

either way.

Such details don't limit you in any way or provide you

with any benefit beyond the spell's effects. You don't

have to justify how you're using tools to cast a spell.

But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way

to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.

when you cast it). You must be proficient with the

tool to use it in this way. See the equipment chap

ter in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of

these tools.

After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level,

you can also use any item bearing one of your infu

sions as a spellcasting focus.

CANTRIPS (O-LEVEL SPELLS)

You know two cantrips of your choice from the arti

ficer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional

artificer can trips of your choice, as shown in the

Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.

When you gain a level in this class, you can re

place one of the artificer cantrips you know with

another cantrip from the artificer spell list.

PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS

The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you

have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your

artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must ex

pend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain

all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of artificer spells that are

available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer

spell list. When you do so, choose a number of arti

ficer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half

your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one

spell). The spells must be of a level for which you

have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you

have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots.

With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared

spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in

any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell

cure wounds, you can cast it using a lst-level or a

2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it

from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when

you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artifi

cer spells requires time spent tinkering with your

spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level

for each spell on your list.

CHAPTER 1  I  CHARACTER OPTIONS

SPELLCASTING ABILITY

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your arti

ficer spells; your understanding of the theory behind

magic allows you to wield these spells with superior

skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer

spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition,

you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the

saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and

when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC= 8 + your proficiency bonus+ your

Intelligence modifier

Spell attack modifier= your proficiency bonus+ your

Intelligence modifier

RITUAL CASTING

You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell

has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

ARTIFICER SPELL LIST

Here's the list of spells you consult when you learn

an artificer spell. The list is organized by spell level,

not character level. If a spell can be cast as a ritual,

the ritual tag appears after the spell's name.

Each spell is in the Player's Handbook,  unless it

has one asterisk (a spell in chapter 3) or two aster

isks (a spell in Xanathar's Guide to Everything).

INFUSE ITEM

2nd-level artificer feature

You've gained the ability to imbue mundane items

with certain magical infusions, turning those ob

jects into magic items.

INFUSIONS KNOWN

When you gain this feature, pick four artificer in

fusions to learn, choosing from the "Artificer Infu

sions" section at the end of the class's description.

You learn additional infusions of your choice when

you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in

the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.

Whenever you gain a level in this class. you can re

place one of the artificer infusions you learned with

a new one.

INFUSING AN ITEM

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a

nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your

artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An

infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as

specified in the infusion's description. If the item re

quires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the

instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to

the item later, you must do so using the normal pro

cess for attunement (see the attunement rules in the

Dungeon Master's Guide).

FLASH OF GENIUS

7th-level artificer feature

You've gained the ability to come up with solutions

under pressure. When you or another creature you

can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check

or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add

your Intelligence modifier to the roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal

to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once).

You regain all expended uses when you finish a

long rest.

MAGIC ITEM ADEPT

10th-level artificer feature

You've achieved a profound understanding of how to

use and make magic items:

You can attune to up to four magic items at once.

If you craft a magic item with a rarity of com

mon or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the

normal time, and it costs you half as much of the

usual gold.

SPELL-STORING ITEM

11th-level artificer feature

You can now store a spell in an object. Whenever

you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or

martial weapon or one item that you can use as a

spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choos

ing a lst- or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell

list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn't have it

prepared).

Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely,  but

when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number

of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (mini

mum of 1  day). The infusion also vanishes if you

replace your knowledge of the infusion.

You can infuse more than one nonmagical object

at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of

objects appears in the Infused Items column of the

Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects,

and each of your infusions can be in only one object

at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than

one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed

your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infu

sion ends, and then the new infusion applies.

If an infusion ends on an item that contains other

things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly

appear in and around its space.

ARTIFICER SPECIALIST

3rd-level artificer feature

Choose the type of specialist you are: Alchemist,

Armorer, Artillerist, or Battle Smith, each of which

is detailed after the class's description. Your choice

grants you features at 5th level and again at 9th and

15th level.

THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB

3rd-level artificer feature

You've learned how to produce exactly the tool you

need: with thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand,

you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in

an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This cre

ation requires 1  hour of uninterrupted work, which

can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the

product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they

vanish when you use this feature again.

ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

4th-level artificer feature

When you reach 4th level and again at 8th, 12th,

16th, and 19th level, you can increase one abil

ity score of your choice by 2, or you can increase

two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal,

you can't increase an ability score above 20 using

this feature.

TOOL EXPERTISE

6th-level artificer feature

Your proficiency bonus is now doubled for any

ability check you make that uses your proficiency

with a tool.

DWARF ALCHEMIST WITH

[ioMUNCULUS  SERVANT

CHAPTER 1  ]  CHARACTER OPTIONS

13

While holding the object, a creature can take an

action to produce the spell's effect from it, using

your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell re

quires concentration, the creature must concentrate.

The spell stays in the object until it's been used a

number of times equal to twice your Intelligence

modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this

feature again to store a spell in an object.

ALCHEMIST SPELLS

3rd-level Alchemist feature

You always have certain spells prepared after you

reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the

Alchemist Spells table. These spells count as arti

ficer spells for you, but they don't count against the

number of artificer spells you prepare.

MAGIC ITEM SAVANT

14th-level artificer feature

Your skill with magic items deepens:

You can attune to up to five magic items at once.

You ignore all class, race, spell, and level require

ments on attuning to or using a magic item.

MAGIC ITEM MASTER

18th-level artificer feature

You can now attune to up to six magic items at once.

SOUL OF ARTIFICE

20th-level artificer feature

You have developed a mystical connection to your

magic items, which you can draw on for protection:

You gain a +l bonus to all saving throws per

magic item you are currently attuned to.

If you're reduced to O hit points but not killed out

right, you can use your reaction to end one of your

artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit

point instead of 0.

EXPERIMENTAL ELIXIR

3rd-level Alchemist feature

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can magi

cally produce an experimental elixir in an empty

flask you touch. Roll on the Experimental Elixir

table for the elixir's effect, which is triggered when

someone drinks the elixir. As an action, a creature

can drink the elixir or administer it to an incapaci

tated creature.

You can create additional experimental elixirs

by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for

each one. When you do so, you use your action to

create the elixir in an empty flask you touch, and

you choose the elixir's effect from the Experimental

Elixir table.

Creating an experimental elixir requires you to

have alchemist supplies on your person, and any

elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is

drunk or until the end of your next long rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, you

can make more elixirs at the end of a long rest: two

at 6th level and three at 15th level. Roll for each

ALCHEMICAL SAVANT

5th-level Alchemist feature

You've developed masterful command of magical

chemicals, enhancing the healing and damage you

create through them. Whenever you cast a spell

using your alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting

focus, you gain a bonus to one roll of the spell. That

roll must restore hit points or be a damage roll that

deals acid, fire, necrotic, or poison damage, and

the bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (mini

mum of+l).

RESTORATIVE REAGENTS

9th-level Alchemist feature

You can incorporate restorative reagents into some

of your works:

Whenever a creature drinks an experimental

elixir you created, the creature gains temporary

hit points equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence modifier

(minimum of 1 temporary hit point).

You can cast lesser restoration without expend

ing a spell slot and without preparing the spell,

casting focus. You can do so a number of times

equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of

once), and you regain all expended uses when you

finish a long rest.

CHEMICAL MASTERY

15th-level Alchemist feature

You have been exposed to so many chemicals that

they pose little risk to you, and you can use them to

quickly end certain ailments:

You gain resistance to acid damage and poison

damage, and you are immune to the poisoned

condition.

You can cast greater restoration and heal without

expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell,

and without material components, provided you

use alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus.

Once you cast either spell with this feature, you

can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a

long rest.

An artificer who specializes as an Armorer modifies

armor to function almost like a second skin. The

armor is enhanced to hone the artificer's magic,

unleash potent attacks, and generate a formidable

defense. The artificer bonds with this armor, becom

ing one with it even as they experiment with it and

refine its magical capabilities.

TOOLS OF THE TRADE

3rd-level Armorer feature

You gain proficiency with heavy armor. You also

gain proficiency with smith's tools. If you already

have this tool proficiency, you gain proficiency with

one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

ARMORER SPELLS

3rd-level Armorer feature

You always have certain spells prepared after you

reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the

Armorer Spells table. These spells count as artificer

spells for you, but they don't count against the num

ARCANE ARMOR

3rd-level Armorer feature

Your metallurgical pursuits have led to you mak

ing armor a conduit for your magic. As an action,

you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing

into Arcane Armor, provided you have smith's

tools in hand.

You gain the following benefits while wearing

this armor:

If the armor normally has a Strength requirement,

the arcane armor lacks this requirement for you.

You can use the arcane armor as a spellcasting

focus for your artificer spells.

The armor attaches to you and can't be removed

against your will. It also expands to cover your

entire body, although you can retract or deploy the

helmet as a bonus action. The armor replaces any

CHAPTER 1  I  CHARACTER OPTIONS

missing limbs, functioning identically to a limb

it replaces.

You can doff or don the armor as an action.

The armor continues to be Arcane Armor until

you don another suit of armor or you die.

ARMOR MODEL

3rd-level Armorer feature

You can customize your Arcane Armor. When you

do so, choose one of the following armor models:

Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives

you special benefits while you wear it.

Each model includes a special weapon. When you

attack with that weapon, you can add your Intelli

gence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to

the attack and damage rolls.

You can change the armor's model whenever you

finish a short or long rest, provided you have smith's

tools in hand.

Guardian. You design your armor to be in the

front line of conflict. It has the following features:

Thunder Gauntlets. Each of the armor's gauntlets

counts as a simple melee weapon while you aren't

holding anything in it, and it deals ld8 thunder

damage on a hit. A creature hit by the gauntlet has

disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other

than you until the start of your next turn, as the ar

mor magically emits a distracting pulse when the

creature attacks someone else.

CHAPTER 1  ]  CHARACTER OPTIONS

Defensive Field. As a bonus action, you can gain

temporary hit points equal to your level in this

class, replacing any temporary hit points you al

ready have. You lose these temporary hit points if

you doff the armor. You can use this bonus action

a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus,

and you regain all expended uses when you finish

a long rest.

Infiltrator. You customize your armor for subtle

undertakings. It has the following features:

Lightning Launcher. A gemlike node appears on

one of your armored fists or on the chest (your

choice). It counts as a simple ranged weapon, with

a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 300

feet. and it deals 1d6 lightning damage on a hit.

Once on each of your turns when you hit a crea

ture with it, you can deal an extra ld6 lightning

damage to that target.

Powered Steps. Your walking speed increases

by 5 feet.

Dampening Field. You have advantage on Dexterity

(Stealth) checks. If the armor normally imposes

disadvantage on such checks, the advantage and

disadvantage cancel each other, as normal.

EXTRA ATTACK

5th-level Armorer feature

You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever

you take the Attack action on your turn.

A RMOR M ODIFICATIONS

9th-level Armorer feature

TOOL PROFICIENCY

3rd-level Artillerist feature

You learn how to use your artificer infusions to spe

cially modify your Arcane Armor. That armor now

counts as separate items for the purposes of your

Infuse Items feature: armor (the chest piece), boots,

helmet, and the armor's special weapon. Each of

those items can bear one of your infusions, and the

infusions transfer over if you change your armor's

model with the Armor Model feature. In addition,

the maximum number of items you can infuse at

once increases by 2, but those extra items must be

part of your Arcane Armor.

PERFECTED ARMOR

15th-level Armorer feature

Your Arcane Armor gains additional benefits based

on its model, as shown below.

Guardian. When a Huge or smaller creature you

can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can

use your reaction to magically force the creature to

make a Strength saving throw against your spell

save DC, pulling the creature up to 30 feet toward

you to an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to

a space within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee

weapon attack against it as part of this reaction.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal

to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex

pended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

Infiltrator. Any creature that takes lightning dam

age from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with

magical light until the start of your next turn. The

glimmering creature sheds dim light in a 5-foot ra

dius, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls against

you, as the light jolts it if it attacks you. In addition,

the next attack roll against it has advantage, and if

that attack hits, the target takes an extra ld6 light

ning damage.

ARTILLERIST

Sore artificers ask the hard queftio: "(ouldu't there

be eve ore collateral daaqe?"

)

TAHA

An Artillerist specializes in using magic to hurl

energy, projectiles, and explosions on a battlefield.

This destructive power is valued by armies in the

wars on many different worlds. And when war

passes, some members of this specialization seek to

build a more peaceful world by using their powers

to fight the resurgence of strife. The world-hopping

gnome artificer Vi has been especially vocal about

making things right: "It's about time we fixed things

instead of blowing them all to hell."

You gain proficiency with woodcarver's tools. If you

already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency

with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

ARTILLERIST SPELLS

3rd-level Artillerist feature

You always have certain spells prepared after you

reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the

Artillerist Spells table. These spells count as arti

ficer spells for you, but they don't count against the

number of artificer spells you prepare.

ELDRITCH CANNON

3rd-level Artillerist feature

You've learned how to create a magical cannon.

Using woodcarver's tools or smith's tools, you can

take an action to magically create a Small or Tiny

eldritch cannon in an unoccupied space on a hori

zontal surface within 5 feet of you. A Small eldritch

cannon occupies its space, and a Tiny one can be

held in one hand.

Once you create a cannon, you can't do so again

until you finish a long rest or until you expend a

spell slot to create one. You can have only one can

non at a time and can't create one while your can

non is present.

The cannon is a magical object. Regardless of

size, the cannon has an AC of 18 and a number of

hit points equal to five times your artificer level. It is

immune to poison damage and psychic damage. If it

is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw,

treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the mending

spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disap

pears if it is reduced to O hit points or after 1 hour.

You can dismiss it early as an action.

When you create the cannon, you determine its

appearance and whether it has legs. You also de

cide which type it is, choosing from the options on

the Eldritch Cannons table. On each of your turns,

you can take a bonus action to cause the cannon to

activate if you are within 60 feet of it. As part of the

same bonus action, you can direct the cannon to

walk or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space,

provided it has legs.

CHAPTER 1  I  CHARACTER OPTIONS

ARCANE FIREARM

5th-level Artillerist feature

You know how to turn a wand, staff, or rod into an

arcane firearm, a conduit for your destructive spells.

When you finish a long rest, you can use woodcarv

er's tools to carve special sigils into a wand, staff,

or rod and thereby turn it into your arcane firearm.

The sigils disappear from the object if you later

carve them on a different item. The sigils otherwise

last indefinitely.

You can use your arcane firearm as a spellcasting

focus for your artificer spells. When you cast an ar

tificer spell through the firearm, roll a d8, and you

gain a bonus to one of the spell's damage rolls equal

to the number rolled.

EXPLOSIVE CANNON

9th-level Artillerist feature

Every eldritch cannon you create is now more

destructive:

The cannon's damage rolls all increase by ld8.

As an action, you can command the cannon to

detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so

destroys the cannon and forces each creature

within 20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving

throw against your spell save DC, taking 3d8 force

damage on a failed save or half as much damage

on a successful one.

FORTIFIED POSITION

15th-level Artillerist feature

You're a master at forming well-defended emplace

ments using your Eldritch Cannon:

You and your allies have half cover while within

10 feet of a cannon you create with Eldritch Can

non, as a result of a shimmering field of magical

protection that the cannon emits.

You can now have two cannons at the same time.

You can create two with the same action (but not

the same spell slot), and you can activate both of

them with the same bonus action. You determine

whether the cannons arc identical to each other

or different. You can't create a third cannon while

you have two.

CHAPTER 1  I  CHARACTER OPTIONS

Armies require protection, and someone has to put

things back together if defenses fail. A combination

of protector and medic, a Battle Smith is an expert

at defending others and repairing both materiel and

personnel. To aid in their work, Battle Smiths are

accompanied by a steel defender,  a protective com

panion of their own creation. Many soldiers tell sto

ries of nearly dying before being saved by a Battle

Smith and a steel defender.

In the world of Eberron, Battle Smiths played

a key role in House Cannith's work on battle con

structs and the original warforged, and after the

Last War,  these artificers led efforts to aid those

who were injured in the war's horrific battles.

TOOL PROFICIENCY

3rd-level Battle Smith feature

You gain proficiency with smith's tools. If you al

one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

3rd-level Battle Smith feature

Your combat training and your experiments with

magic have paid off in two ways:

You gain proficiency with martial weapons.

When you attack with a magic weapon, you

can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of

Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack and

damage rolls.

STEEL DEFENDER

3rd-level Battle Smith feature

Your tinkering has borne you a companion, a steel

defender. It's friendly to you and your companions,

and it obeys your commands. See its game statis

tics in the Steel Defender stat block, which uses

your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You

determine the creature's appearance and whether it

has two legs or four; your choice has no effect on its

game statistics.

In combat, the defender shares your initiative

count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours.

It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the

only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action,

unless you take a bonus action on your turn to com

mand it to take another action. That action can be

one in its stat block or some other action. If you are

incapacitated, the def ender can take any action of its

choice, not just Dodge.

If the mending spell is cast on the defender, it

regains 2d6 hit points. If it has died within the last

hour, you can use your smith's tools as an action

to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and

you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The

defender returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit

points restored.

At the end of a long rest, you can create a new

steel defender if you have smith's tools with you. If

you already have a defender from this feature, the

first one immediately perishes. The defender also

perishes if you die.

You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever

you take the Attack action on your turn.

ARCANE JOLT

9th-level Battle Smith feature

You've learned new ways to channel arcane energy

to harm or heal. When either you hit a target with

a magic weapon attack or your steel defender hits a

target, you can channel magical energy through the

strike to create one of the following effects:

The target takes an extra 2d6 force damage.

Choose one creature or object you can see within

30 feet of the target. Healing energy flows into the

chosen recipient, restoring 2d6 hit points to it.

You can use this energy a number of times equal

to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), but

you can do so no more than once on a turn. You re

gain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

IMPROVED DEFENDER

15th-level Battle Smith feature

Your Arcane Jolt and steel defender have become

more powerful:

The extra damage and the healing of your Arcane

Jolt both increase to 4d6.

Your steel defender gains a +2 bonus to

ARTIFICER INFUSIONS

Artificer infusions are extraordinary processes that

rapidly turn a nonmagical object into a magic item.

The description of each of the following infusions

details the type of object that can receive it, along

with whether the resulting magic item requires

attunement.

Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level.

You can't learn such an infusion until you are at

least that level.

Unless an infusion's description says otherwise,

you can't learn an infusion more than once.

!

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Beast draw

their rage from a bestial spark burning within their

souls. That beast bursts forth in the throes of rage,

physically transforming the barbarian.

Such a barbarian might be inhabited by a primal

spirit or be descended from shape-shifters. You can

choose the origin of your feral might or determine it

by rolling on the Origin of the Beast table.

ORIGIN OF THE BEAST

FORM OF THE BEAST

3rd-level Path of the Beast feature

When you enter your rage, you can transform, re

vealing the bestial power within you. Until the rage

ends, you manifest a natural weapon. It counts as

a simple melee weapon for you, and you add your

Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolb

when you attack with it, as normal.

You choose the weapon's form each time you rage:

Bite. Your mouth transforms into a bestial muzzle

or great mandibles (your choice). It deals ld8

piercing damage on a hit. Once on each of your

turns when you damage a creature with this bite,

you regain a number of hit points equal to your

proficiency bonus, provided you have less than

half your hit points when you hit.

Claws. Each of your hands transforms into a claw,

which you can use as a weapon if it's empty. It

deals ld6 slashing damage on a hit. Once on each

of your turns when you attack with a claw using

the Attack action, you can make one additional

claw attack as part of the same action.

Tail. You grow a lashing, spiny tail, which deals ld8

piercing damage on a hit and has the reach prop

erty. If a creature you can see within 10 feet of

you hits you with an attack roll, you can use your

reaction to swipe your tail and roll a d8, applying

a bonus to your AC equal to the number rolled, po

tentially causing the attack to miss you.

BESTIAL SOUL

6th-level Path of the Beast feature

The feral power within you increases, causing the

natural weapons of your Form of the Beast to count

as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance

and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

You can also alter your form to help you adapt to

your surroundings. When you finish a short or long

rest, choose one of the following benefits, which

lasts until you finish your next short or long rest:

You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking

speed, and you can breathe underwater.

You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking

speed, and you can climb difficult surfaces, includ

ing upside down on ceilings, without needing to

make an ability check.

When you jump, you can make a Strength (Athlet

ics) check and extend your jump by a number of

feet equal to the check's total. You can make this

special check only once per turn.

INFECTIOUS FURY

10th-level Path of the Beast feature

When you hit a creature with your natural weapons

while you are raging, the beast within you can curse

your target with rabid fury. The target must succeed

Many places in the multiverse abound with beauty,

intense emotion, and rampant magic; the Feywild,

the Upper Planes, and other realms of supernatural

power radiate with such forces and can profoundly

influence people. As folk of deep feeling, barbarians

are especially susceptible to these wild influences,

with some barbarians being transformed by the

magic. These magic-suffused barbarians walk the

Path of Wild Magic. Elf, tiefling, aasimar, and genasi

barbarians often seek this path, eager to manifest

the otherworldly magic of their ancestors.

MAGIC AWARENESS

3rd-level Path of Wild Magic feature

As an action, you can open your awareness to the

presence of concentrated magic. Until the end of

your next turn, you know the location of any spell

or magic item within 60 feet of you that isn't behind

total cover. When you sense a spell, you learn which

school of magic it belongs to.

You can use this feature a number of times equal

to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex

WILD SURGE

3rd-level Path of Wild Magic feature

The magical energy roiling inside you sometimes

erupts from you. When you enter your rage, roll on

this effect again on each of your turns as a bonus

action.

An intangible spirit, which looks like a tlumph or

a pixie (your choice), appears within 5 feet of one

creature of your choice that you can see within

30 feet of you. At the end of the current turn, the

spirit explodes, and each creature within 5 feet

of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or

take ld6 force damage. Until your rage ends, you

can use this effect again, summoning another

spirit, on each of your turns as a bonus action.

Magic infuses one weapon of your choice that

you are holding.  Until your rage ends, the weap

the light and thrown properties, with a normal

range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.  If the

weapon leaves your hand, the weapon reappears

in your hand at the end of the current turn.

Whenever a creature hits you with an attack roll

before your rage ends, that creature takes ld6

force damage, as magic lashes out in retribution.

Until your rage ends, you are surrounded by

multicolored, protective lights; you gain a+ l  bo

BARDIC VERSATILITY

4th-level bard feature

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants

the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do

one of the following, representing a change in focus

as you use your skills and magic:

Replace one of the skills you chose for the Exper

tise feature with one of your other skill proficien

cies that isn't benefiting from Expertise.

Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's

Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the

bard spell list.

BARD COLLEGES

At 3rd level, a bard gains the Bard College feature,

which offers you the choice of a subclass. The fol

lowing options are available to you when making

that choice: College of Creation and College of

Eloquence.

COLLEGE OF CREATION

Oe bard'\ {oq o} reatiow is the {core to aother'

per\ow'\ iqhtmare\.

Bards believe the cosmos is a work of art-- the cre

ation of the first dragons and gods. That creative

work included harmonies that continue to resound

through existence today, a power known as the

Song of Creation. The bards of the College of Cre

ation draw on that primeval song through dance,

music, and poetry, and their teachers share this

lesson: "Before the sun and the moon, there was the

Song, and its music awoke the first dawn. Its melo

dies so delighted the stones and trees that some of

them gained a voice of their own. And now they sing

too. Learn the Song, students, and you too can teach

the mountains to sing and dance."

Dwarves and gnomes often encourage their bards

to become students of the Song of Creation. And

among dragonborn, the Song of Creation is revered,

for legends portray Bahamut and Tiamat-the great

est of dragons -as two of the song's first singers.

MOTE OF POTENTIAL

3rd-level College of Creation feature

Whenever you give a creature a Bardic Inspiration

die, you can utter a note from the Song of Creation

to create a Tiny mote of potential, which orbits

within 5 feet of that creature. The mote is intangi

ble and invulnerable, and it lasts until the Bardic

Inspiration die is lost. The mote looks like a musical

note, a star, a flower, or another symbol of art or life

that you choose.

When the creature uses the Bardic Inspiration

die, the mote provides an additional effect based on

whether the die benefits an ability check, an attack

roll, or a saving throw, as detailed below:

Ability Check. When the creature rolls the Bardic

Inspiration die to add it to an ability check, the

creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die again

and choose which roll to use, as the mote pops

and emits colorful, harmless sparks for a moment.

Attack Roll. Immediately after the creature rolls

the Bardic Inspiration die to add it to an attack roll

against a target, the mote thunderously shatters.

The target and each creature of your choice that

you can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a

Constitution saving throw against your spell save

DC or take thunder damage equal to the number

rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die.

Saving Throw. Immediately after the creature rolls

the Bardic Inspiration die and adds it to a saving

throw, the mote vanishes with the sound of soft

music, causing the creature to gain temporary hit

points equal to the number rolled on the Bardic

Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier (mini

mum of 1 temporary hit point).

PERFORMANCE OF CREATION

3rd-level College of Creation feature

As an action, you can channel the magic of the Song

of Creation to create one nonmagical item of your

choice in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you.

The item must appear on a surface or in a liquid

that can support it. The gp value of the item can't

be more than 20 times your bard level, and the item

must be Medium or smaller. The item glimmers

softly, and a creature can faintly hear music when

touching it. The created item disappears after a

number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus.

For examples of items you can create, see the equip

ment chapter of the Player's Handbook.

Once you create an item with this feature, you

can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless

you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to use

this feature again. You can have only one item cre

ated by this feature at a time; if you use this action

and already have an item from this feature, the first

one immediately vanishes.

The size of the item you can create with this fea

ture increases by one size category when you reach

6th level (Large) and 14th level (Huge).

ANIMATING PERFORMANCE

6th-level College of Creation feature

As an action, you can target a Large or smaller non

magical item you can see within 30 feet of you and

animate it. The animate item uses the Dancing Item

stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB),

The item is friendly to you and your companions and

obeys your commands. It lives for 1 hour, until it is

reduced to O hit points, or until you die.

In combat, the item shares your initiative count,

but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can

move and use its reaction on its own, but the only

action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless

you take a bonus action on your turn to command it

to take another action. That action can be one in its

stat block or some other action. If you are incapaci

tated, the item can take any action of its choice, not

just Dodge.

When you use your Bardic Inspiration feature, you

can command the item as part of the same bonus

action you use for Bardic Inspiration.

Once you animate an item with this feature, you

can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless

you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use

this feature again. You can have only one item ani

mated by this feature at a time; if you use this action

and already have a dancing item from this feature,

the first one immediately becomes inanimate.

CREATIVE CRESCENDO

14th-level College of Creation feature

When you use your Performance of Creation fea

that would exceed that number, you choose which

of the previously created items disappears. Only one

of these items can be of the maximum size you can

create; the rest must be Small or Tiny.

You are no longer limited by gp value when creat

ing items with Performance of Creation.

d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

UNSETTLING WORDS

3rd-level College of Eloquence feature

You can spin words laced with magic that unsettle

a creature and cause it to doubt itself. As a bonus

action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspi

ration and choose one creature you can see within

60 feet of you. Roll the Bardic Inspiration die. The

creature must subtract the number rolled from the

next saving throw it makes before the start of your

next turn.

UNFAILING INSPIRATION

6th-level College of Eloquence feature

Your inspiring words are so persuasive that others

feel driven to succeed. When a creature adds one

of your Bardic Inspiration dice to its ability check,

attack roll, or saving throw and the roll fails, the

creature can keep the Bardic Inspiration die.

UNIVERSAL SPEECH

6th-level College of Eloquence feature

You gain the ability to make your speech intelligible

to any creature. As an action, choose one or more

creatures within 60 feet of you, up to a number

equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one

creature). The chosen creatures can magically un

derstand you, regardless of the language you speak,

for 1 hour.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again

until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a

spell slot of any level to use it again.

INFECTIOUS INSPIRATION

14th-level College of Eloquence feature

When you successfully inspire someone, the power

of your eloquence can now spread to someone else.

When a creature within 60 feet of you adds one of

your Bardic Inspiration dice to its ability check, at

tack roll, or saving throw and the roll succeeds, you

can use your reaction to encourage a different crea

ture (other than yourself) that can hear you within

60 feet of you, giving it a Bardic Inspiration die with

out expending any of your Bardic Inspiration uses.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal

to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and

you regain all expended uses when you finish a

long rest.

ORDER DOMAIN

The Order Domain represents discipline, as well as

logic and justice as they serve their gods, examples

of which appear in the Order Deities table.

Clerics of Order believe that well-crafted laws es

tablish legitimate hierarchies, and those selected by

law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must

do so to the best of their ability, and if those who

lead fail to protect the law, they must be replaced. In

this manner, law weaves a web of obligations that

create order and security in a chaotic multiverse.

some of the gods associated with this domain.

Clerics of the Peace Domain preside over the sign

DRUID

The druid class receives new features and sub

classes in this section.

OPTIONAL CLASS FEATURES

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook

when you reach certain levels in your class. This

section offers additional features that you can gain

as a druid. Unlike the features in the Player's Hand

book, you don't gain the features here automatically.

Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to

gain a feature in this section if you meet the level re

quirement noted in the feature's description. These

features can be selected separately from one an

other; you can use some, all, or none of them.

ADDITIONAL DRUID SPELLS

Ist-level druid feature

The spells in the following list expand the druid

spell list in the Player's Handbook. The list is orga

nized by spell level, not character level. If a spell can

be cast as a ritual, the ritual tag appears after the

spell's name. Each spell is in the Player's Handbook,

unless it has an asterisk (a spell in chapter 3). Xana

thar's Guide to Everything also offers more spells.

WILD COMPANION

2nd-level druid feature

You gain the ability to summon a spirit that assumes

an animal form: as an action, you can expend a use

of your Wild Shape feature to cast the find familiar

spell, without material components.

CHAPTER 1  I  CHARACTER OPTIONS

Druids of the Circle of Spores find beauty in decay.

They see within mold and other fungi the ability

to transform lifeless material into abundant, albeit

somewhat strange, life. These druids believe that

life and death are parts of a grand cycle, with one

leading to the other and then back again. Death isn't

the end of life, but instead a change of state that

sees life shift into a new form.

Druids of this circle have a complex relationship

with the undead. They see nothing inherently wrong

with undeath, which they consider to be a compan

ion to life and death. But these druids believe that

the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment

of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to

replace all life with undeath, or that try to avoid

passing to a final rest, violate the cycle and must

be thwarted.

CIRCLE SPELLS

2nd-level Circle of Spores feature

Your symbiotic link to fungi and your ability to tap

into the cycle of life and death grants you access

to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the chill

touch cantrip.

At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to

the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Spores

Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these

spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't

count against the number of spells you can prepare

each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't

appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonethe

less a druid spell for you.

2nd-level Circle of Spores feature

You are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores

that are harmless until you unleash them on a crea

ture nearby. When a creature you can see moves

into a space within 10 feet of you or starts its turn

there, you can use your reaction to deal ld4 necrotic

damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a

Constitution saving throw against your spell save

DC. The necrotic damage increases to ld6 at 6th

level, ld8 at 10th level, and ldlO at 14th level.

D R U I D  W IT H  W IL D  C O M P A N IO N

When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar

CANTRIP VERSATILITY

4th-level druid feature

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants

SYMBIOTIC ENTITY

2nd-level Circle of Spores feature

You gain the ability to channel magic into your

spores. As an action, you can expend a use of your

Wild Shape feature to awaken those spores, rather

than transforming into a beast form, and you gain 4

temporary hit points for each level you have in this

class. While this feature is active, you gain the fol

lowing benefits:

When you deal your Halo of Spores damage,

roll the damage die a second time and add it to

the total.

Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 ne

crotic damage to any target they hit.

These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose

all these temporary hit points. or until you use your

Wild Shape again.

FUNGAL INFESTATION

6th-level Circle of Spores feature

Your spores gain the ability to infest a corpse and

animate it. If a beast or a humanoid that is Small

or Medium dies within 10 feet of you, you can use

your reaction to animate it, causing it to stand up

immediately with 1 hit point. The creature uses

the Zombie stat block in the Monster Manual. It

remains animate for 1 hour, after which time it col-

lapses and dies.

In combat, the zombie's turn comes immediately

after yours. It obeys your mental commands, and

the only action it can take is the Attack action, mak

ing one melee attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal

to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and

you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a

long rest.

SPREADING SPORES

10th-level Circle of Spores feature

You gain the ability to seed an area with deadly

spores. As a bonus action while your Symbiotic

Entity feature is active, you can hurl spores up to

30 feet away, where they swirl in a 10-foot cube for

1 minute. The spores disappear early if you use

this feature again, if you dismiss them as a bonus

action, or if your Symbiotic Entity feature is no lon

ger active.

Whenever a creature moves into the cube or

starts its turn there, that creature takes your Halo

of Spores damage, unless the creature succeeds on

a Constitution saving throw against your spell save

DC. A creature can take this damage no more than

once per turn.

While the cube of spores persists, you can't use

your Halo of Spores reaction.

CHAPTER 1  I  CHARACTER OPTIONS

STAR MAP

2nd-level Circle of the Stars feature

You've created a star chart as part of your heavenly

studies. It is a Tiny object and can serve as a spell

casting focus for your druid spells. You determine

its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by

choosing one.

While holding this map, you have these benefits:

You know the guidance cantrip.

You have the guiding bolt spell prepared. It

counts as a druid spell for you, and it doesn't

count against the number of spells you can

have prepared.

You can cast guiding bolt without expending a

spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal

to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex

pended uses when you finish a long rest.

If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour cer

emony to magically create a replacement. This cere

mony can be performed during a short or long rest,

and it destroys the previous map.

The Circle of Stars allows druids to draw on the

power of starlight. These druids have tracked heav

enly patterns since time immemorial, discovering

secrets hidden amid the constellations. By revealing

and understanding these secrets, the Circle of the

Stars seeks to harness the powers of the cosmos.

Many druids of this circle keep records of the con

stellations and the stars' effects on the world. Some

groups document these observations at megalithic

sites, which serve as enigmatic libraries of lore.

These repositories might take the form of stone cir

cles, pyramids, petroglyphs, and underground tem

ples any construction durable enough to protect

the circle's sacred knowledge even against a great

cataclysm.

STARRY FORM

2nd-level Circle of the Stars feature

As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your

Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form, rather

than transforming into a beast.

While in your starry form, you retain your game

statistics, but your body becomes luminous; your

joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect

them as on a star chart. This form sheds bright light

in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional

10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early

if you dismiss it (no action required), are incapaci

tated, die, or use this feature again.

Whenever you assume your starry form, choose

which of the following constellations glimmers on

your body; your choice gives you certain benefits

while in the form:

Archer. A constellation of an archer appears on

you. When you activate this form, and as a bonus

action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you

can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a lumi-

nous arrow that targets one creature within 60

feet of you. On a hit, the attack deals radiant dam

age equal to ld8 + your Wisdom modifier.

Chalice. A constellation of a life-giving goblet ap

pears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using

a spell slot that restores hit points to a creature,

you or another creature within 30 feet of you

can regain hit points equal to ld8 + your Wis

dom modifier.

Dragon. A constellation of a wise dragon appears

on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wis

dom check or a Constitution saving throw to main

tain concentration on a spell, you can treat a roll

of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.

COSMIC OMEN

6th-level Circle of the Stars feature

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can consult

your Star Map for omens. When you do so, roll a

die. Until you finish your next long rest, you gain

access to a special reaction based on whether you

rolled an even or an odd number on the die:

Weal (even). Whenever a creature you can see

within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack

roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can

use your reaction to roll a d6 and add the number

rolled to the total.

Woe (odd). Whenever a creature you can see within

30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a

saving throw, or an ability check, you can use

your reaction to roll a d6 and subtract the number

rolled from the total.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal

to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex

pended uses when you finish a long rest.

TWINKLING CONSTELLATIONS

10th-level Circle of the Stars feature

The constellations of your Starry Form improve.

The ld8 of the Archer and the Chalice becomes

2d8, and while the Dragon is active, you have a fly

ing speed of 20 feet and can hover.

Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while

in your Starry Form, you can change which constel

lation glimmers on your body.

FULL OF STARS

14th-level Circle of the Stars feature

While in your Starry Form, you become partially

incorporeal, giving you resistance to bludgeoning,

piercing, and slashing damage.

Druids within the Circle of Wildfire understand that

destruction is sometimes the precursor of creation,

such as when a forest fire promotes later growth.

These druids bond with a primal spirit that harbors

both destructive and creative power, allowing the

druids to create controlled flames that burn away

one thing but give life to another.

CIRCLE SPELLS

2nd-level Circle of Wildfire feature

You have formed a bond with a wildfire spirit, a

primal being of creation and destruction. Your link

with this spirit grants you access to some spells

when you reach certain levels in this class, as

shown on the Circle of Wildfire Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you

always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against

the number of spells you can prepare each day. If

you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on

the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid

spell for you.

SUMMON WILDFIRE SPIRIT

2nd-level Circle of Wildfire feature

You can summon the primal spirit bound to your

soul. As an action, you can expend one use of your

Wild Shape feature to summon your wildfire spirit,

rather than assuming a beast form.

The spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your

choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each

creature within 10 feet of the spirit (other than you)

when it appears must succeed on a Dexterity sav

ing throw against your spell save DC or take 2d6

fire damage.

The spirit is friendly to you and your companions

and obeys your commands. See this creature's

game statistics in the Wildfire Spirit stat block,

which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several

places. You determine the spirit's appearance. Some

spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of

gnarled branches covered in flame, while others

look like beasts wreathed in fire.

ENHANCED BOND

6th-level Circle of Wildfire feature

The bond with your wildfire spirit enhances your de

a spell that deals fire damage or restores hit points

while your wildfire spirit is summoned, roll a d8,

other than self, the spell can originate from you or

your wildfire spirit.

10th-level Circle of Wildfire feature

You gain the ability to turn death into magical

flames that can heal or incinerate. When a Small

or larger creature dies within 30 feet of you or your

wildfire spirit, a harmless spectral flame springs

forth in the dead creature's space and flickers there

for 1 minute. When a creature you can see enters

that space, you can use your reaction to extinguish

the spectral flame there and either heal the creature

or deal fire damage to it. The healing or damage

equals 2dl0 + your Wisdom modifier.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal

to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex

pended uses when you finish a long rest.

BLAZING REVIVAL

14th-level Circle of Wildfire feature

The bond with your wildfire spirit can save you fror

death. If the spirit is within 120 feet of you when

you are reduced to O hit points and thereby fall un

conscious, you can cause the spirit to drop to O hit

points. You then regain half your hit points and im

mediately rise to your feet.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again

until you finish a long rest.

those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a

maneuver you use requires your target to make a

saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the

saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus

+ your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).

You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this

die is added to any superiority dice you have from

another source). This die is used to fuel your maneu

vers. A superiority die is expended when you use it.

Awake to the psionic power within, a Psi Warrior

is a fighter who augments their physical might

with psi-infused weapon strikes, telekinetic lashes,

and barriers of mental force. Many githyanki

train to become such warriors, as do some of the

most disciplined high elves. In the world of Eber

ron, many young kalashtar dream of becoming

Psi Warriors.

CHAPTER 1]CHARACTER OPTIONS

As a Psi Warrior,  you might have honed your

psionic abilities through solo discipline, unlocked

it under the tutelage of a master, or refined it at an

academy dedicated to wielding the mind's power as

both weapon and shield.

PSIONIC POWER

3rd-level Psi Warrior feature

You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within

yourself. This energy is represented by your

Psionic Energy dice, which are each a d6. You

have a number of these dice equal to twice your

proficiency bonus, and they fuel various psionic

powers you have, which are detailed below.

Some of your powers expend the Psionic En

ergy die they use, as specified in a power's de

scription, and you can't use a power if it requires

you to use a die when your dice are all expended.

You regain all your expended Psionic Energy dice

when you finish a long rest. In addition, as a bo

nus action, you can regain one expended Psionic

Energy die, but you can't do so again until you

finish a short or long rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, the

size of your Psionic Energy dice increases: at 5th

level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (dl2).

The powers below use your Psionic

Energy dice.

Protective Field. When you or another crea-

ture you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage,

you can use your reaction to expend one Psionic En

ergy die, roll the die, and reduce the damage taken

by the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier

(minimum reduction of 1), as you create a momen

tary shield of telekinetic force.

Psionic Strike. You can propel your weapons

Rune Knights enhance their martial prowess using

the supernatural power of runes, an ancient prac

tice that originated with giants. Rune cutters can

be found among any family of giants, and you likely

learned your methods first or second hand from

such a mystical artisan. Whether you found the gi

ant's work carved into a hill or cave, learned of the

runes from a sage, or met the giant in person, you

studied the giant's craft and learned how to apply

magic runes to empower your equipment.

BONUS PROFICIENCIES

3rd-level Rune Knight feature

You gain proficiency with smith's tools, and you

learn to speak, read, and write Giant.

RUNE CARVER

3rd-level Rune Knight feature

You can use magic runes to enhance your gear.

You learn two runes of your choice, from among

the runes described below, and each time you gain

a level in this class, you can replace one rune you

you reach certain levels in this class, you learn addi

tional runes, as shown in the Runes Known table.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a

number of objects equal to the number of runes you

know, and you inscribe a different rune onto each

of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a

weapon, a suit of armor, a shield, a piece of jewelry,

or something else you can wear or hold in a hand.

Your rune remains on an object until you finish a

long rest, and an object can bear only one of your

runes at a time.

The following runes are available to you when you

learn a rune. If a rune has a level requirement, you

must be at least that level in this class to learn the

rune. If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune

Magic save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Constitution modifier.

Cloud Rune. This rune emulates the deceptive

magic used by some cloud giants. While wearing

or carrying an object inscribed with this rune,

you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)

checks and Charisma (Deception) checks.

In addition, when you or a creature you can see

within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can

use your reaction to invoke the rune and choose a

different creature within 30 feet of you, other than

the attacker. The chosen creature becomes the tar

get of the attack, using the same roll. This magic

can transfer the attack's effects regardless of the

attack's range. Once you invoke this rune, you can't

do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

Fire Rune. This rune's magic channels the mas

terful craftsmanship of great smiths. While wearing

or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, your

proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check

you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.

In addition, when you hit a creature with an at

tack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to

summon fiery shackles: the target takes an extra

2d6 fire damage, and it must succeed on a Strength

saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. While

restrained by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire

damage at the start of each of its turns. The target

can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its

turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once

you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you

finish a short or long rest.

Frost Rune. This rune's magic evokes the might

of those who survive in the wintry wilderness, such

as frost giants. While wearing or carrying an object

inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on

Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks and Charisma

(Intimidation) checks.

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus

action to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes,

you gain a +2 bonus to all ability checks and saving

throws that use Strength or Constitution. Once you

invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you fin

ish a short or long rest.

Stone Rune. This rune's magic channels the judi

ciousness associated with stone giants. While wear

ing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune,

you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks,

and you have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

In addition, when a creature you can see ends its

turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction

to invoke the rune and force the creature to make

a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds,

the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While

charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of

0 and is incapacitated, descending into a dreamy

stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at

the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a

success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so

again until you finish a short or long rest.

Hill Rune (7th Level or Higher). This rune's

magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill gi

ant. While wearing or carrying an object that bears

this rune, you have advantage on saving throws

against being poisoned, and you have resistance

against poison damage.

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus

action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing,

and slashing damage for 1 minute. Once you invoke

this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a

short or long rest.

Storm Rune (7th Level or Higher). Using this

rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant

seer. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed

with this rune, you have advantage on Intelligence

(Arcana) checks, and you can't be surprised as long

as you aren't incapacitated.

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus

action to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute or until

you're incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you

or another creature you can see within 60 feet of

you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an abil

ity check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll

to have advantage or disadvantage. Once you invoke

this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a

short or long rest.

You have learned how to imbue yourself with the

might of giants. As a bonus action, you magically

If you are smaller than Large, you become

Large, along with anything you are wearing. If

you lack the room to become Large, your size

Strength saving throws.

Once on each of your turns, one of your attacks

with a weapon or an unarmed strike can deal an

cxtra 1d6 damage to a target on a hit.

You can use this feature a number of times equal

to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex

pended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

RUNIC  SHIELD

7th-level Rune Knight feature

You learn to invoke your rune magic to protect your

allies. When another creature you can see within 60

The magic of your runes permanently alters you.

When you gain this feature, roll 3d4. You grow a

Moreover, the extra damage you deal with your

Giant's Might feature increases to ld8.

Love, money, or some other obligation motivates you

to sniff out potential threats and see your charge

through dangerous situations.

MASTER OF RUNES

15th-level Rune Knight feature

You can invoke each rune you know from your Rune

Carver feature twice, rather than once, and you

reach increases by 5 feet.

BATTLE MASTER BUILDS

A Martial Archetype option in the Player's Hand

book, the Battle Master showcases just how ver

satile a fighter can be. The suite of maneuvers you

choose, when combined with a fighting style and

feats, allows you to create a broad range of fighters,

each with its own flavor and play style. Below are

recommendations for how you might build a Battle

Master to reflect various types of warriors.

Each of these builds contains suggested fighting

styles, maneuvers, and feats. Those suggestions

are from the Player's Handbook, except for the ones

followed by an asterisk, which indicates an option

introduced in this book.

ARCHER

Fighting Style: Archery

Maneuvers: Disarming Strike, Distracting Strike,

Precision Attack

Feats: Sharpshooter

You prefer to deal with your enemies from afar,

trusting in a well-placed arrow, javelin, or sling

bullet to end a fight without a response. You rely on

accuracy and probably subscribe to the axiom that

"those who live by the sword die by the bow."

BRAWLER

Fighting Style: Blind Fighting, Two-Weapon Fight

ing, Unarmed Fighting

Maneuvers: Ambush,* Disarming Attack, Feinting

Attack, Pushing Attack, Trip Attack

Feats: Athlete, Durable, Grappler, Resilient, Shield

Master, Tavern Brawler, Tough

When bottles start breaking and chairs start flying,

you're in your element. You love a good scrap, and

you've likely seen your share of them. You may or

may not have formal training, and while others

might call you a dirty fighter, you're still alive.

DUELIST

Fighting Style: Dueling, Two-Weapon Fighting

Maneuvers: Evasive Footwork, Feinting Attack,

Lunging Attack, Parry, Precision Attack, Riposte

Feats: Defensive Duelist, Dual Wielder, Observant,

Savage Attacker, Weapon Master

You regard the duel as a proud tradition, a test of

skill and wits that brings honor to those who can de

feat an enemy while respecting the art. Your search

for improvement is a consuming passion, and you

draw on the expertise of the masters who've come

before you as you work to perfect your form.

GLADIATOR

Fighting Style: Defense, Two-Weapon Fighting

Maneuvers: Goading Attack, Menacing Attack,

Sweeping Attack, Trip Attack

Feats: Athlete, Charger, Dual Wielder, Durable,

Grappler, Savage Attacker, Tough, Weapon Master

You've fought to entertain crowds, whether for sport

or as punishment. Along the way, you learned to use

all manner of weapons to battle all kinds of adver

saries. You're practical yet theatrical, and you know

how to employ fear as an effective tool in a fight.

CHAPTER 1  I  CHARACTER OPTIONS

HOPLITE

Fighting Style: Defense, Thrown Weapon Fighting

Maneuvers: Brace, Lunging Attack, Parry, Preci

sion Attack

Feats: Athlete, Grappler, Polearm Master, Sentinel,

Shield Master

With spear and shield, you follow in the footsteps of

the heroes of ages past. You rely on discipline and

athleticism to overcome improbable odds. Whether

fighting in ranks alongside your comrades or squar

ing off as a lone warrior, you're equal to the task.

LANCER

Fighting Style: Dueling

Maneuvers: Lunging Attack, Menacing Attack, Pre

cision Attack, Pushing Attack

Feats: Heavy Armor Master, Mounted Combatant,

Savage Attacker

When the cavalry is called in, that means you. You

ride out to greet your enemy with the point of your

weapon. As you charge, the ground trembles, and

only the heaviest blows can deter you.

OUTRIDER

Fighting Style: Archery

Maneuvers: Ambush,* Distracting Strike, Goading

Attack, Precision Attack, Quick Toss

Feats: Alert, Crossbow Expert, Mounted Combat-

ant, Observant, Sharpshooter

You find freedom in the saddle and a companion

in your mount. A headlong charge into combat is a

blunt instrument for oafs. You prefer mobility and

range, opting to find advantageous positions that al

low you to deal with foes at full gallop while evading

the most dangerous threats.

PUGILIST

Fighting Style: Unarmed Fighting

Maneuvers: Disarming Attack, Evasive Footwork,

Grappling Strike,* Menacing Attack, Pushing At

tack, Riposte, Trip Attack

Feats: Athlete, Durable, Grappler, Savage Attacker,

Tavern Brawler

Where others rely on steel, you've got your fists.

Whether through training or experience, you've

developed a superior technique that can help you

overcome an enemy in an up-close fight.

SHOCK TROOPER

Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting

Maneuvers: Menacing Attack, Pushing Attack,

Sweeping Attack

Feats: Charger, Great Weapon Master, Heavy

Armor Master

SHOCK TROOPER

Subtlety is not your style. You're trained to get

straight into the fighting, busting through enemy

lines and applying tremendous pressure quickly.

Those who ignore you in combat do so at their peril.

SKIRMISHER

Fighting Style: Archery, Thrown Weapon Fighting

Maneuvers: Ambush,* Bait and Switch,* Distracting

Strike, Quick Toss

Feats: Alert, Dual Wielder, Mobile, Skulker

You thrive amid the chaos of battle. You use your

mobility and versatility in combat to soften your ad

versaries and disrupt their formations. An enemy's

plan rarely survives contact with you.

STRATEGIST

Fighting Style: Defense

Maneuvers: Commander's Strike, Commanding

Presence,* Maneuvering Attack, Rally, Tactical

Assessment*

Feats: Inspiring Leader, Keen Mind, Linguist

To you, battles unfold like a game of chess. You un

derstand that strength and speed are important in

a fight, but it takes intellect and experience to know

how best to apply them. That's where you come in.

MONK

The monk class receives new features and sub

classes in this section.

OPTIONAL CLASS FEATURES

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook

when you reach certain levels in your class. This

section offers additional features that you can gain

as a monk. Unlike the features in the Player's Hand

book, you don't gain the features here automatically.

Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to

gain a feature in this section if you meet the level re

quirement noted in the feature's description. These

features can be selected separately from one an

other; you can use some, all, or none of them.

DEDICATED WEAPON

2nd-level monk feature

You train yourself to use a variety of weapons as

monk weapons, not just simple melee weapons and

shortswords. Whenever you finish a short or long

rest, you can touch one weapon, focus your ki on it,

and then count that weapon as a monk weapon until

you use this feature again.

The chosen weapon must meet these criteria:

The weapon must be a simple or martial weapon.

You must be proficient with it.

It must lack the heavy and special properties.

KI-FUELED ATTACK

3rd-level monk feature

If you spend 1 ki point or more as part of your action

on your turn, you can make one attack with an tun

Monks of the Way of Mercy learn to manipulate

the life force of others to bring aid to those in need.

They are wandering physicians to the poor and hurt.

However, to those beyond their help, they bring a

swift end as an act of mercy.

Those who follow the Way of Mercy might be

members of a religious order, administering to the

needy and making grim choices rooted in reality

rather than idealism. Some might be gentle-voiced

healers, beloved by their communities, while others

might be masked bringers of macabre mercies.

The walkers of this way usually don robes with

deep cowls, and they often conceal their faces with

masks, presenting themselves as the faceless bring

ers of life and death.

IMPLEMENTS  OF MERCY

3rd-level Way of Mercy feature

You gain proficiency in the Insight and Medi

cine skills, and you gain proficiency with the

herbalism kit.

You also gain a special mask, which you often

You can use this feature only once per turn.

PHYSICIAN'S TOUCH

6th-level Way of Mercy feature

You can administer even greater cures with a touch,

and if you feel it's necessary,  you can use your

knowledge to cause harm.

When you use Hand of Healing on a creature, you

can also end one disease or one of the following

When you use Hand of Harm on a creature, you

can subject that creature to the poisoned condition

FLURRY OF HEALING AND HARM

1lth-level Way of Mercy feature

Hand of Harm. You can still use Hand of Harm only

once per turn.

HAND OF ULTIMATE MERCY

17th-level Way of Mercy feature

Your mastery of life energy opens the door to the

ultimate mercy. As an action, you can touch the

revives with them removed: blinded, deafened, para

lyzed, poisoned, and stunned.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again

until you finish a long rest.

WAY OF THE ASTRAL SELF

Note to sell: create a Spell that lets qou throat-puich

people with your qhost.

s,

TASHA

A monk who follows the Way of the Astral Self be

lieves their body is an illusion. They see their ki as a

representation of their true form, an astral self. This

astral self has the capacity to be a force of order or

disorder, with some monasteries training students

to use their power to protect the weak and other

instructing aspirants in how to manifest their true

selves in service to the mighty.

ARMS OF THE ASTRAL SELF

3rd-level Way of the Astral Self feature

Your mastery of your ki allows you to summon a

portion of your astral self. As a bonus action, you

can spend 1  ki point to summon the arms of your

astral self. When you do so, each creature of your

choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must

succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take force

damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die.

For 10 minutes, these spectral arms hover near

your shoulders or surround your arms (your choice).

You determine the arms' appearance, and they van

ish early if you are incapacitated or die.

While the spectral arms are present, you gain the

following benefits:

You can use your Wisdom modifier in place of

your Strength modifier when making Strength

checks and Strength saving throws.

You can use the spectral arms to make un

armed strikes.

When you make an unarmed strike with the arms

on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater

than normal.

The unarmed strikes you make with the arms

can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your

Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and

damage rolls, and their damage type is force.

VISAGE OF THE ASTRAL SELF

6th-level Way of the Astral Self feature

You can summon the visage of your astral self. As a

bonus action, or as part of the bonus action you take

to activate Arms of the Astral Self, you can spend

1 ki point to summon this visage for 10 minutes. It

vanishes early if you are incapacitated or die.

The spectral visage covers your face like a helmet

or mask. You determine its appearance.

FORMS OF YOUR ASTRAL SELF

The astral self is a translucent embodiment of the

monk's soul. As a result, an astral self can reflect

aspects of a monk's background, ideals, flaws, and

bonds, and an astral self doesn't necessarily look any

thing like the monk. for example, the astral self of a

lanky human might be reminiscent of a minotaur--the

strength of which the monk feels within. Similarly, an

orc monk might manifest gossamer arms and a deli

cate visage, representing the gentle beauty of the ore's

soul. Each astral self is unique, and some of the monks

of this monastic tradition are known more for the

appearance of their astral self than for their physical

appearance.

When choosing this path, consider the quirks that

define your monk. Are you obsessed with something?

Are you driven by justice or a selfish desire? Any of

these motivations could manifest in the form of your

astral self.

Armor of the Spirit. You gain a +2 bonus to

Armor Class.

Astral Barrage. Whenever you use the Extra At

tack feature to attack twice, you can instead attack

three times if all the attacks are made with your

astral arms.

While the spectral visage is present, you gain the

following benefits.

Astral Sight. You can see normally in dark

ness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance

of 120 feet.

Wisdom of the Spirit, You have advantage

on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Intimida

tion) checks.

Word of the Spirit. When you speak, you can di-

rect your words to a creature of your choice that you

can see within 60 feet of you, making it so only that

creature can hear you. Alternatively, you can am

plify your voice so that all creatures within 600 feet

can hear you.

BODY OF THE ASTRAL SELF

11th-level Way of the Astral Self feature

When you have both your astral arms and visage

summoned, you can cause the body of your astral

self to appear (no action required). This spectral

body covers your physical form like a suit of armor,

connecting with the arms and visage. You deter

mine its appearance.

While the spectral body is present, you gain the

following benefits.

Deflect Energy. When you take acid, cold, fire,

force, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use

your reaction to deflect it. When you do so, the

damage you take is reduced by ldlO + your Wisdom

modifier (minimum reduction of 1).

Empowered Arms. Once on each of your turns

when you hit a target with the Arms of the As-

tral Self, you can deal extra damage to the

target equal to your Martial Arts die.

(

AWAKENED ASTRAL SELF

17th-level Way of the Astral Self

feature

Your connection to your astral self

is complete, allowing you to un

leash its full potential. As a bonus

action, you can spend 5 ki points to

summon the arms, visage, and body

of your astral self and awaken it for

10 minutes. This awakening ends

early if you are incapacitated or die.

While your astral self is awakened,

you gain the following benefits.

encourage their companions so they're all ready

when destiny calls.

TENETS OF GLORY

tempt heroics that might one day shine in legend.

Actions over Words. Strive to be known by glori

ous deeds, not words.

TIEFLING

PALADIN OF GLORY

Challenges Are but Tests. Face hardships

with courage, and encourage your allies to face

them with you.

Hone the Body. Like raw stone, your body must

be worked so its potential can be realized.

cipline to overcome failings within yourself that

threaten to dim the glory of you and your friends.

CHANNEL DIVINITY

3rd-level Oath of Glory feature

LIVING LEGEND

20th-level Oath of Glory feature

You gain the following two Channel Divinity op

tions. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how

Channel Divinity works.

Peerless Athlete. As a bonus action, you can

use your Channel Divinity to augment your athleti

cism. For the next 10 minutes, you have advantage

on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics)

checks; you can carry, push, drag, and lift twice as

much weight as normal; and the distance of your

long and high jumps increases by 10 feet (this extra

distance costs movement as normal).

Inspiring Smite. Immediately after you deal dam

age to a creature with your Divine Smite feature,

you can use your Channel Divinity as a bonus action

and distribute temporary hit points to creatures

of your choice within 30 feet of you, which can in

clude you. The total number of temporary hit points

equals 2d8 + your level in this class, divided among

the chosen creatures however you like.

AURA OF ALACRITY

7th-level Oath of Glory feature

You emanate an aura that fills you and your com

panions with supernatural speed, allowing you to

race across a battlefield in formation. Your walking

speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, if you aren't

incapacitated, the walking speed of any ally who

starts their turn within 5 feet of you increases by 10

feet until the end of that turn.

When you reach 18th level in this class, the range

of the aura increases to 10 feet.

GLORIOUS DEFENSE

15th-level Oath of Glory feature

You can turn defense into a sudden strike. When

you or another creature you can see within 10 feet

of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your re

action to grant a bonus to the target's AC against

that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The bonus

equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of +l). If

the attack misses, you can make one weapon attack

against the attacker as part of this reaction, pro

vided the attacker is within your weapon's range.

You can use this feature a number of times equal

to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and

you regain all expended uses when you finish a

long rest.

You can empower yourself with the legends

whether true or exaggerated-of your great deeds.

As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits

for 1 minute:

You are blessed with an otherworldly presence,

gaining advantage on all Charisma checks.

Once on each of your turns when you make a

weapon attack and miss, you can cause that attack

to hit instead.

If you fail a saving throw, you can use your reac

tion to reroll it. You must use this new roll.

Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it

again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend

a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.

OATH OF THE WATCHERS

These paladi are't at all up to what I  expected.

Worse, they fed hone your party's bet quests.

}

TASHA

The Oath of the Watchers binds paladins to protect

mortal realms from the predations of extraplanar

creatures, many of which can lay waste to mortal

soldiers. Thus, the Watchers hone their minds, spir

its, and bodies to be the ultimate weapons against

such threats.

Paladins who follow the Watchers' oath are ever

vigilant in spotting the influence of extraplanar

forces, often establishing a network of spies and

informants to gather information on suspected

cults. To a Watcher, keeping a healthy suspicion and

awareness about one's surroundings is as natural as

wearing armor in battle.

TENETS OF THE WATCHERS

A paladin who assumes the Oath of the Watchers

swears to safeguard mortal realms from other

worldly threats.

Vigilance. The threats you face are cunning,

powerful, and subversive. Be ever alert for their

corruption.

Loyalty.  Never accept gifts or favors from fiends or

those who truck with them. Stay true to your order,

your comrades, and your duty.

Discipline. You are the shield against the endless

terrors that lie beyond the stars. Your blade must be

forever sharp and your mind keen to survive what

lies beyond.

of your faith. As an action, you can choose a number

of creatures you can see within 30 feet of you, up

to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (min

imum of one creature). For 1 minute, you and the

chosen creatures have advantage on Intelligence,

Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

Abjure the Extraplanar.  You can use your Chan

nel Divinity to castigate unworldly beings. As an

action, you present your holy symbol and each

aberration, celestial, elemental, fey,  or fiend within

30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wis

dom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is

turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to

move as far away from you as it can, and it can't

willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of

you. For its action, it can use only the Dash action

or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from

moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can

take the Dodge action.

AURA OF THE SENTINEL

7th-level Oath of the Watchers feature

You emit an aura of alertness while you aren't in

capacitated. When you and any creatures of your

choice within 10 feet of you roll initiative, you

a Charisma saving throw against your spell save

DC. On a failed save, the creature is magically

banished to its native plane of existence if it's cur

rently not there. On a successful save, the creature

can't be banished by this feature for 24 hours.

RANGER

The ranger class receives new features and sub

classes in this section.

OPTIONAL CLASS FEATURES

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook

when you reach certain levels in your class. This

section offers additional features that you can gain

as a ranger. Unlike the features in the Player's

Handbook, you don't gain the features here automat

ically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether

to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level

requirement noted in the feature's description.

These features can be selected separately from one

another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

If you take a feature that replaces another feature,

you gain no benefit from the replaced one and don't

qualify for anything in the game that requires it.

DEFT EXPLORER

1st-level ranger feature, which replaces the Natural

Explorer feature

You are an unsurpassed explorer and survivor, both

in the wilderness and in dealing with others on your

travels. You gain the Canny benefit below, and you

gain an additional benefit below when you reach 6th

level and 10th level in this class.

a climbing speed and a swimming speed equal to

your walking speed.

As an action, you can give yourself a number of

temporary hit points equal to ld8 + your Wisdom

In addition, whenever you finish a short rest, your

exhaustion level, if any,  is decreased by 1.

FAVORED FOE

1st-level ranger feature,  which replaces the Favored

Enemy feature and works with the Foe Slayer

feature

When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can

call on your mystical bond with nature to mark the

target as your favored enemy for 1 minute or until

you lose your concentration (as if you were concen

trating on a spell).

The first time on each of your turns that you hit

the favored enemy and deal damage to it, includ

ing w-hen you mark it, you can increase that dam

age by ld4.

You can use this feature to mark a favored enemy

a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus,

and you regain all expended uses when you finish a

ness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature

within that range, unless the creature successfully

hides from you.

DRUIDIC WARRIOR

You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid

In addition, whenever you or a creature you can

the effect on itself on a successful save.

FEY REINFORCEMENTS

Feeling a deep connection to the environment

around them, some rangers reach out through their

magical connection to the world and bond with a

swarm of nature spirits. The swarm becomes a po

tent force in battle, as well as helpful company for

the ranger.  Some Swarmkeepers are outcasts or

hermits, kccping to themselves and their attendant

swarms rather than dealing with the discomfort of

others. Other Swarmkeepers enjoy building vibrant

communities that work for the mutual benefit of all

IT's YOUR SWARM

A Swarmkeeper's swarm and spells are reflections

of the character's bond with nature spirits. Take the

opportunity to describe the swarm and the ranger's

magic in play.  For example, when your ranger casts

gaseous form, they might appear to melt into the

swarm, instead of a cloud of mist, or the arcane eye

spell could create an extension of your swarm that

spies for you. Such descriptions don't change the ef

fects of spells, but they are an exciting opportunity to

explore your character's narrative through their class

abilities. For more guidance on customizing spells, see

the "Personalizing Spells" section in chapter 3.

Also, remember that the swarm's appearance is

yours to customize, and don't feel confined to a single

appearance.  Perhaps the spirits' look changes with the

ranger's mood or with the seasons. You decide!

WRITHING TIDE

7th-level Swarm keeper feature

You can condense part of your swarm into a focused

mass that lifts you up. As a bonus action, you gain

a flying speed of 10 feet and can hover. This effect

lasts for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated.

You can use this feature a number of times equal

to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex

pended uses when you finish a long rest.

MIGHTY SWARM

11th-level Swarmkeeper feature

Your Gathered Swarm grows mightier in the fol

The damage of Gathered Swarm increases to ld8.

If a creature fails its saving throw against being

moved by Gathered Swarm, you can also cause

the swarm to knock the creature prone.

When you are moved by Gathered Swarm, it gives

you half cover until the start of your next turn.

SWARMING DISPERSAL

15th-level Swarm keeper feature

You can discorporate into your swarm, avoiding

danger. When you take damage, you can use your

reaction to give yourself resistance to that damage.

You vanish into your swarm and then teleport to an

unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of

you, where you reappear with the swarm.

You can use this feature a number of times equal

a mystical bond with an animal. As an alternative,

a Beast Master can take the feature below to form a

bond with a special primal beast instead.

PRIMAL COMPANION

3rd-level Beast Master feature, which replaces the

Ranger's Companion feature

You magically summon a primal beast, which draws

strength from your bond with nature. The beast

is friendly to you and your companions and obeys

your commands. Choose its stat block-Beast of the

Land, Beast of the Sea, or Beast of the Sky-which

You also determine the kind of animal the beast

is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block.

Whatever kind you choose, the beast bears primal

markings, indicating its mystical origin.

In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can

move and use its reaction on its own, but the only

action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take

a bonus action on your turn to command it to take

another action. That action can be one in its stat

block or some other action. You can also sacrifice

one of your attacks when you take the Attack action

to command the beast to take the Attack action. If

you are incapacitated, the beast can take any action

of its choice, not just Dodge.

If the beast has died within the last hour, you can

use your action to touch it and expend a spell slot of

ROGUISH ARCHETYPES

feature, which offers you the choice of a subclass.

The following options are available to you when

making that choice: the Phantom and the Soulknife.

PHANTOM

ROGUE

The rogue class receives new features and sub

classes in this section.

OPTIONAL CLASS FEATURE

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook

when you reach certain levels in your class. This

section offers an additional feature that you can gain

as a rogue. Unlike the features in the Player's Hand

book, you don't gain the feature here automatically.

Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to

gain the feature in this section if you meet the level

requirement noted in the feature's description.

STEADY AIM

3rd-level rogue feature

As a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on

your next attack roll on the current turn. You can

use this bonus action only if you haven't moved

during this turn, and after you use the bonus action,

your speed is O until the end of the current turn.

TAHA

Many rogues walk a fine line between life and

death, risking their own lives and taking the lives of

others. While adventuring on that line, some rogues

discover a mystical connection to death itself. These

rogues take knowledge from the dead and become

immersed in negative energy, eventually becoming

like ghosts. Thieves' guilds value them as highly ef

fective information gatherers and spies.

Many shadar-kai of the Shadowfell are masters

of these macabre techniques, and some are willing

to teach this path. In places like Thay in the Forgot

ten Realms and Karrnath in Eberron, where many

necromancers practice their craft, a Phantom can

become a wizard's confidant and right hand. In tem

ples of gods of death, the Phantom might work as

an agent to track down those who try to cheat death

and to recover knowledge that might otherwise be

lost to the grave.

How did you discover this grim power? Did

you sleep in a graveyard and awaken to your new

abilities? Or did you cultivate them in a temple or

thieves' guild dedicated to a deity of death?

WHISPERS  OF THE DEAD

3rd-level Phantom feature

Echoes of those who have died cling to you. When

ever you finish a short or long rest, you can choose

one skill or tool proficiency that you lack and gain

it, as a ghostly presence shares its knowledge with

you. You lose this proficiency when you use this fea

ture to choose a different proficiency that you lack.

WAILS FROM THE GRAVE

3rd-level Phantom feature

As you nudge someone closer to the grave, you can

channel the power of death to harm someone else

as well. Immediately after you deal your Sneak

Attack damage to a creature on your turn, you can

target a second creature that you can see within

30 feet of the first creature. Roll half the number of

Sneak Attack dice for your level (round up), and the

second creature takes necrotic damage equal to the

rail's total,  as wails of the dead sound around them

for a moment.

You can use this feature a number of times equal

to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex

pended uses when you finish a long rest.

TOKENS OF THE DEPARTED

9th-level Phantom feature

When a life ends in your presence, you're able to

snatch a token from the departing soul, a sliver of

its life essence that takes physical form: as a reac

tion when a creature you can see dies within 30

feet of you, you can open your free hand and cause

a Tiny trinket to appear there, a soul trinket. The

DM determines the trinket's form or has you roll

on the Trinkets table in the Player's Handbook to

generate it.

You can have a maximum number of soul trinkets

equal to your proficiency bonus, and you can't create

one while at your maximum.

You can use soul trinkets in the following ways:

While a soul trinket is on your person, you have

advantage on death saving throws and Constitu

tion saving throws, for your vitality is enhanced by

the life essence within the object.

When you deal Sneak Attack damage on your

turn, you can destroy one of your sou I trinkets

that's on your person and then immediately use

Wails from the Grave, without expending a use of

that feature.

As an action, you can destroy one of your soul

trinkets, no matter where it's located. When you

do so, you can ask the spirit associated with the

trinket one question. The spirit appears to you

and answers in a language it knew in life. It's un

der no obligation to be truthful, and it answers as

concisely as possible, eager to be free. The spirit

knows only what it knew in life, as determined

by the DM.

GHOST WALK

13th-level Phantom feature

You can phase partially into the realm of the dead,

becoming like a ghost. As a bonus action, you as

sume a spectral form. While in this form, you have

a flying speed of 10 feet, you can hover, and attack

rolls have disadvantage against you. You can also

move through creatures and objects as if they were

difficult terrain, but you take ldlO force damage if

you end your turn inside a creature or an object.

You stay in this form for 10 minutes or until you

end it as a bonus action. To use this feature again,

you must finish a long rest or destroy one of your

soul trinkets as part of the bonus action you use to

activate Ghost Walk.

DEATH'S FRIEND

17th-level Phantom feature

Your association with death has become so close

that you gain the following benefits:

When you use your Wails from the Grave, you can

deal the necrotic damage to both the first and the

second creature.

At the end of a long rest, a soul trinket appears in

your hand if you don't have any soul trinkets, as

the spirits of the dead are drawn to you.

TASHA

Most assassins strike with physical weapons,

and many burglars and spies use thieves' tools to

infiltrate secure locations. In contrast, a Soulk

nife strikes and infiltrates with the mind, cutting

through barriers both physical and psychic. These

rogues discover psionic power within themselves

and channel it to do their roguish work. They find

easy employment as members of thieves' guilds,

CHAPTER 1  ]  CHARACTER OPTIONS  63

Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy

die they use, as specified in a power's description,

and you can't use a power if it requires you to use a

die when your dice are all expended. You regain all

your expended Psionic Energy dice when you finish

a long rest. In addition, as a bonus action, you can

regain one expended Psionic Energy die, but you

can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, the

size of your Psionic Energy dice increases: at 5th

level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).

The powers below use your Psionic Energy dice.

Psi-Bolstered Knack. When your nonpsionic

training fails you, your psionic power can help: if

you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with

which you have proficiency, you can roll one Psionic

Energy die and add the number rolled to the check,

potentially turning failure into success. You expend

the die only if the roll succeeds.

Psychic Whispers. You can establish telepathic

communication between yourself and others-per

fect for quiet infiltration. As an action, choose one

or more creatures you can see, up to a number of

creatures equal to your proficiency bonus, and then

roll one Psionic Energy die. For a number of hours

equal to the number rolled, the chosen creatures

can speak telepathically with you, and you can

speak telepathically with them. To send or receive

a message (no action required), you and the other

creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A crea

ture can't use this telepathy if it can't speak any lan

guages, and a creature can end the telepathic con

nection at any time (no action required). You and the

creature don't need to speak a common language to

understand each other.

The first time you use this power after each long

rest, you don't expend the Psionic Energy die. All

other times you use the power, you expend the die.

PSYCHIC BLADES

3rd-level Soulknife feature

You can manifest your psionic power as shimmer

ing blades of psychic energy. Whenever you take

the Attack action, you can manifest a psychic blade

from your free hand and make the attack with that

blade. This magic blade is a simple melee weapon

with the finesse and thrown properties. It has a nor

mal range of 60 feet and no long range, and on a hit,

it deals psychic damage equal to ld6 plus the ability

modifier you used for the attack roll. The blade van

ishes immediately after it hits or misses its target,

and it leaves no mark on its target if it deals damage.

After you attack with the blade, you can make

a melee or ranged weapon attack with a second

[i A L F L IN G

S O U L K N I F E

though they are often mistrusted by rogues who are

leery of anyone using strange mind powers to con

duct their business. Most governments would also

be happy to employ a Soulknife as a spy.

Amid the trees of ancient forests on the Material

Plane and in the Feywild, some wood elves walk

the path of the Soulknife, serving as silent, lethal

guardians of their woods. In the endless war among

the gith, a githzerai is encouraged to become a

Soulknife when stealth is required against the

githyanki foe.

As a Soulknife, your psionic abilities might have

haunted you since you were a child, only revealing

their full potential as you experienced the stress of

adventure. Or you might have sought out a reclusive

order of psychic adepts and spent years learning

how to manifest your power.

PSIONIC POWER

3rd-level Soulknife feature

You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within

yourself. This energy is represented by your Psionic

Energy dice, which are each a d6. You have a num

ber of these dice equal to twice your proficiency bo

nus, and they fuel various psionic powers you have,

which are detailed below.

turn, provided your other hand is free to create

stead of ld6.

SOUL BLADES

9th-level Soulknife feature

Your Psychic Blades are now an expression of your

psi-suffused soul, giving you these powers that use

your Psionic Energy dice:

Homing Strikes. If you make an attack roll with

your Psychic Blades and miss the target, you can

roll one Psionic Energy die and add the number

rolled to the attack roll. If this causes the attack to

hit, you expend the Psionic Energy die.

Psychic Teleportation. As a bonus action, you

manifest one of your Psychic Blades, expend one

Psionic Energy die and roll it, and throw the blade at

an unoccupied space you can see, up to a number of

feet away equal to 10 times the number rolled. You

then teleport to that space, and the blade vanishes.

PSYCHIC VEIL

13th-level Soulknife feature

You can weave a veil of psychic static to mask

yourself. As an action, you can magically become

invisible, along with anything you are wearing or

carrying, for 1 hour or until you dismiss this effect

(no action required). This invisibility ends early im

mediately after you deal damage to a creature or you

force a creature to make a saving throw.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again

until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a

Psionic Energy die to use this feature again.

REND MIND

17th-level Soul knife feature

You can sweep your Psychic Blades directly through

a creature's mind. When you use your Psychic

Blades to deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature,

you can force that target to make a Wisdom saving

throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Dexterity modifier). If the save fails, the target

is stunned for 1 minute. The stunned target can re

peat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,

ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again

until you finish a long rest, unless you expend three

Psionic Energy dice to use it again.

faint motes of light sparkle around you.

You gain resistance to psychic damage, and you

have advantage on saving throws against being

charmed or frightened.

REVELATION IN FLESH

14th-level Aberrant Mind feature

You can unleash the aberrant truth hidden within

yourself. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 or

more sorcery points to magically transform your

formation ends:

You can see any invisible creature within 60 feet

of you, provided it isn't behind total cover. Your

sory tendrils.

You gain a flying speed equal to your walking

speed, and you can hover. As you fly, your skin

space-warping anomaly. As an action, you can tele

port to an unoccupied space you can see within 120

The cosmic force of order has suffused you with

magic. That power arises from Mechanus or a

realm like it-a plane of existence shaped entirely by

clockwork efficiency. You, or someone from your lin

eage, might have become entangled in the machina

tions of the modrons, the orderly beings who inhabit

Mechanus. Perhaps your ancestor even took part in

the Great Madron March. Whatever its origin within

you, the power of order can seem strange to others,

but for you, it is part of a vast and glorious system.

CLOCKWORK MAGIC

1st-level Clockwork Soul feature

You learn additional spells when you reach certain

levels in this class, as shown on the Clockwork

Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sor

cerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the

number of sorcerer spells you know.

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can re

RESTORE BALANCE

1st-level Clockwork Soul feature

Your connection to the plane of absolute order al

lows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a crea

ture you can see within 60 feet of you is about to roll

a d20 with advantage or disadvantage, you can use

your reaction to prevent the roll from being affected

by advantage and disadvantage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal

to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex

pended uses when you finish a long rest.

BASTION OF LAW

6th-level Clockwork Soul feature

You can tap into the grand equation of existence to

imbue a creature with a shimmering shield of order.

As an action, you can expend 1 to 5 sorcery points

to create a magical ward around yourself or another

creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The ward

lasts until you finish a long rest or until you use this

feature again.

The ward is represented by a number of d8s equal

to the number of sorcery points spent to create it.

When the warded creature takes damage, it can ex

pend a number of those dice, roll them, and reduce

the damage taken by the total rolled on those dice.

TRANCE OF ORDER

14th-level Clockwork Soul feature

You gain the ability to align your consciousness to

the endless calculations of Mechanus. As a bonus

action, you can enter this state for 1 minute. For the

duration, attack rolls against you can't benefit from

advantage, and whenever you make an attack roll,

an ability check, or a saving throw, you can treat a

roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.

Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it

again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5

sorcery points to use it again.

CLOCKWORK CAVALCADE

18th-level Clockwork Soul feature

You summon spirits of order to expunge disorder

around you. As an action, you summon the spirits in

a 30-foot cube originating from you. The spirits look

like modrons or other constructs of your choice.

The spirits are intangible and invulnerable, and they

create the following effects within the cube before

vanishing:

The spirits restore up to 100 hit points, divided

as you choose among any number of creatures of

your choice in the cube.

Any damaged objects entirely in the cube are re

paired instantly.

Every spell of 6th level or lower ends on creatures

and objects of your choice in the cube.

Once you use this action, you can't use it again un

This benefit can be used a number of times equal to

you when making that choice: the Fathomless and

the Genie.

You have plunged into a pact with the deeps. An

entity of the ocean, the Elemental Plane of Water,

or another otherworldly sea now allows you to draw

on its thalassic power. Is it merely using you to learn

about terrestrial realms, or does it want you to open

cosmic floodgates and drown the world?

CHAPTER 1  I  CHARACTER OPTIONS

Perhaps you were born into a generational cult

that venerates the Fathomless and its spawn. Or

you might have been shipwrecked and on the brink

of drowning when your patron's grasp offered you

a chance at life. Whatever the reason for your pact,

the sea and its unknown depths call to you.

Entities of the deep that might empower a warlock

include krakens, ancient water elementals, godlike

hallucinations dreamed into being by kuo-toa, mer

folk demigods, and sea hag covens.

EXPANDED SPELL LIST

1st-level Fathomless feature

The Fathomless lets you choose from an expanded

TENTACLE OF THE DEEPS

Ist-level Fathomless feature

You can magically summon a spectral tentacle that

strikes at your foes. As a bonus action, you create a

10-foot-long tentacle at a point you can see within

60 feet of you. The tentacle lasts for 1 minute or tun

til you use this feature to create another tentacle.

When you create the tentacle, you can make a me

lee spell attack against one creature within 10 feet

of it. On a hit, the target takes ld8 cold damage, and

its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your

next turn. When you reach 10th level in this class,

the damage increases to 2d8.

As a bonu:s action on your turn, you can move the

tentacle up to 30 feet and repeat the attack .

You can summon the tentacle a number of times

equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all

expended uses when you finish a long rest.

GIFT OF THE SEA

1st-level Fathomless feature

You gain a swimming speed of 40 feet, and you can

breathe underwater.

O CEANIC  SOUL

6th-level Fathomless feature

You are now even more at home in the depths. You

gain resistance to cold damage. In addition, when

you are fully submerged, any creature that is also

fully submerged can understand your speech, and

you can understand theirs.

GUARDIAN COIL

6th-level Fathomless feature

Your Tentacle of the Deeps can defend you and

others, interposing itself between them and harm.

When you or a creature you can see takes damage

while within 10 feet of the tentacle, you can use your

reaction to choose one of those creatures and re

duce the damage to that creature by ld8. When you

reach 10th level in this class, the damage reduced

by the tentacle increases to 2d8.

GRASPING TENTACLES

10th-level Fathomless feature

You learn the spell Evard's black tentacles. It counts

as a warlock spell for you, but it doesn't count

against the number of spells you know. You can also

cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the

ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

Whenever you cast this spell, your patron's magic

bolsters you, granting you a number of temporary

hit points equal to your warlock level. Moreover,

damage can't break your concentration on this spell.

FATHOMLESS PLUNGE

4th-level Fathomless feature

You can magically open temporary conduits to

watery destinations. As an action, you can teleport

yourself and up to five other willing creatures that

you can see within 30 feet of you. Amid a whirl of

tentacles, you all vanish and then reappear up to

1 mile away in a body of water you've seen (pond

size or larger) or within 30 feet of it, each of you

appearing in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of

the others.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again

until you finish a short or long rest.

You have made a pact with one of the rarest kinds

of genie, a noble genie. Such entities rule vast fiefs

on the Elemental Planes and have great influence

over lesser genies and elemental creatures. Noble

genies are varied in their motivations, but most are

arrogant and wield power that rivals that of lesser

deities. They delight in turning the table on mortals,

who often bind genies into servitude, and readily en

ter into pacts that expand their reach.

You choose your patron's kind or determine it ran

domly, using the Genie Kind table.

Your patron gifts you a magical vessel that grants

you a measure of the genie's power. The vessel is

While you are touching the vessel, you can use it

Bottled Respite. As an action, you can magically

vanish and enter your vessel, which remains

in the space you left. The interior of the vessel

is an extradimensional space in the shape of a

20-foot-radius cylinder,  20 feet high, and resem

bles your vessel. The interior is appointed with

cushions and low tables and is a comfortable

temperature. While inside, you can hear the area

around your vessel as if you were in its space. You

can remain inside the vessel up to a number of

hours equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You

exit the vessel early if you use a bonus action to

leave, if you die, or if the vessel is destroyed. When

you exit the vessel, you appear in the unoccupied

space closest to it. Any objects left in the vessel

remain there until carried out, and if the vessel is

destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly

appears in the unoccupied spaces closest to the

vessel's former space. Once you enter the vessel,

you can't enter again until you finish a long rest.

Genie's Wrath. Once during each of your turns

when you hit with an attack roll, you can deal ex

tra damage to the target equal to your proficiency

bonus. The type of this damage is determined by

your patron: bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni),

fire (efreeti), or cold (marid).

The vessel's AC equals your spell save DC. Its

hit points equal your warlock level plus your profi

ciency bonus, and it is immune to poison and psy

chic damage.

If the vessel is destroyed or you lose it, you can

perform a I-hour ceremony to receive a replacement

from your patron. This ceremony can be performed

during a short or long rest, and the previous vessel

is destroyed if it still exists. The vessel vanishes in a

flare of elemental power when you die.

ELEMENTAL GIFT

6th-level Genie feature

You begin to take on characteristics of your patron's

kind. You now have resistance to a damage type de

termined by your patron's kind: bludgeoning (dao),

thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid).

In addition, as a bonus action, you can give

yourself a flying speed of 30 feet that lasts for 10

minutes, during which you can hover. You can use

this bonus action a number of times equal to your

proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses

when you finish a long rest.

SANCTUARY VESSEL

10th-level Genie feature

When you enter your Genie's Vessel via the Bot

tled Respite feature, you can now choose up to five

willing creatures that you can see within 30 feet of

you, and the chosen creatures are drawn into the

vessel with you.

As a bonus action, you can eject any number of

creatures from the vessel, and everyone is ejected if

you leave or die or if the vessel is destroyed.

In addition, anyone (including you) who remains

within the vessel for at least 10 minutes gains the

benefit of finishing a short rest, and anyone can add

your proficiency bonus to the number of hit points

they regain if they spend any Hit Dice as part of a

short rest there.

LIMITED WISH

14th-level Genie feature

You entreat your patron to grant you a small wish.

As an action, you can speak your desire to your Ge

nie's Vessel, requesting the effect of one spell that is

6th level or lower and has a casting time of 1 action.

The spell can be from any class's spell list, and you

don't need to meet the requirements in that spell,

including costly components: the spell simply takes

effect as part of this action.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again

until you finish ld4 long rests.

WIZARD

The wizard class receives new features and sub

classes in this section.

OPTIONAL CLASS FEATURES

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook

when you reach certain levels in your class. This

section offers additional features that you can gain

as a wizard. Unlike the features in the Player's

Handbook, you don't gain the features here automat

ically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether

to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level

requirement noted in the feature's description.

These features can be selected separately from one

another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

ADDITIONAL WIZARD SPELLS

1st-level wizard feature

The spells in the following list expand the wizard

spell list in the Player's Handbook. The list is or

ganized by spell level, not character level. Aspell's

school of magic is noted, and if a spell can be cast as

a ritual, the ritual tag appears after the spell's name.

Each spell is in the Player's Handbook, unless it has

an asterisk (a spell in chapter 3). Xanathar's Guide

observed a bladesinger at work remember the

display as one of the more beautiful experiences

in their life, a glorious dance accompanied by a

singing blade.

TRAINING IN WAR AND SONG

2nd level Bladesinging feature

You gain proficiency with light armor, and you gain

proficiency with one type of one-handed melee

weapon of your choice.

You also gain proficiency in the Performance skill

if you don't already have it.

BLADE SONG

2nd-level Bladesinging feature

You can invoke an elven magic called the

Bladesong, provided that you aren't wearing me

dium or heavy armor or using a shield. It graces you

with supernatural speed, agility,  and focus.

You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong,

which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are in

capacitated, if you don medium or heavy armor or

a shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack

with a weapon. You can also dismiss the Bladesong

at any time (no action required).

While your Bladesong is active, you gain the fol

lowing benefits:

A DROW AND  A  IlIGH

ELF LADE SINGER

CANTRIP FORMULAS

3rd-level wizard feature

You have scribed a set of arcane formulas in your

spellbook that you can use to formulate a cantrip

in your mind. Whenever you finish a long rest and

consult those formulas in your spellbook, you can

replace one wizard cantrip you know with another

cantrip from the wizard spell list.

ARCANE TRADITIONS

At 2nd level, a wizard gains the Arcane Tradition

feature, which offers you the choice of a subclass.

The following options are available to you when

making that choice: Bladesinging and the Order

You can use this feature a number of times equal

to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex

pended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

EXTRA ATTACK

6th-level Blade singing feature

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever

you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover,

you can cast one of your can trips in place of one of

those attacks,

SONG OF DEFENSE

10th-level Blade singing feature

You can direct your magic to absorb damage while

You can add your Intelligence modifier (minimum

while your Bladesong is active.

WIZARDLY QUILL

2nd-level Order of Scribes feature

ORDER OF SCRIBES

Magic of the book-that's what many folk call wiz

ardry. The name is apt, given how much time wiz

ards spend poring over tomes and penning theories

about the nature of magic. It's rare to see wizards

traveling without books and scrolls sprouting from

their bags, and a wizard would go to great lengths to

plumb an archive of ancient knowledge.

Among wizards, the Order of Scribes is the most

bookish. It takes many forms in different worlds,

but its primary mission is the same everywhere:

recording magical discoveries so that wizardry can

flourish. And while all wizards value spellbooks, a

wizard in the Order of Scribes magically awakens

their book, turning it into a trusted companion. All

wizards study books, but a wizardly scribe talks

to theirs!

As a bonus action, you can magically create a Tiny

quill in your free hand. The magic quill has the fol

lowing properties:

The quill doesn't require ink. When you write with

it, it produces ink in a color of your choice on the

writing surface.

The time you must spend to copy a spell into your

spell book equals 2 minutes per spell level if you

use the quill for the transcription.

You can erase anything you write with the quill if

you wave the feather over the text as a bonus ac

tion, provided the text is within 5 feet of you.

This quill disappears if you create another one or

if you die.

AWAKENED SPELLBOOK

2nd-level Order of Scribes feature

Using specially prepared inks and ancient incan

tations passed down by your wizardly order, you

have awakened an arcane sentience within your

spellbook.

While you are holding the book, it grants you the

following benefits:

CHAPTER 1  ]  CHARACTER OPTIONS

You can use the book as a spellcasting focus for

your wizard spells.

,  When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot,

you can temporarily replace its damage type with

a type that appears in another spell in your spell

book, which magically alters the spell's formula

for this casting only. The latter spell must be of the

same level as the spell slot you expend.

When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can

use the spell's normal casting time, rather than

adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this benefit,

you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

If necessary, you can replace the book over the

course of a short rest by using your Wizardly Quill

to write arcane sigils in a blank book or a magic

spellbook to which you're attuned. At the end of the

rest, your spellbook's consciousness is summoned

into the new book, which the consciousness trans

forms into your spellbook, along with all its spells.

If the previous book still existed somewhere, all the

spells vanish from its pages.

MASTER SCRIVENER

10th-level Order of Scribes feature

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can create one

magic scroll by touching your Wizardly Quill to a

blank piece of paper or parchment and causing one

spell from your Awakened Spellbook to be copied

onto the scroll. The spellbook must be within 5 feet

of you when you make the scroll.

The chosen spell must be of 1st or 2nd level and

must have a casting time of 1 action. Once in the

scroll, the spell's power is enhanced, counting as

one level higher than normal. You can cast the spell

from the scroll by reading it as an action. The scroll

is unintelligible to anyone else, and the spell van

ishes from the scroll when you cast it or when you

finish your next long rest.

You are also adept at crafting spell scrolls, which

are described in the treasure chapter of the Dun

gcon Master's Guide. The gold and time you must

spend to make such a scroll are halved if you use

your Wizardly Quill.

MANIFEST MIND

6th-level Order of Scribes feature

ONE WITH THE WORD

14th-level Order of Scribes feature

Your connection to your Awakened Spellbook has

become so profound that your soul has become

entwined with it. While the book is on your person,

you have advantage on all Intelligence (Arcana)

checks, as the spellbook helps you remember

magical lore.

Moreover, if you take damage while your spell

book's mind is manifested, you can prevent all of

that damage to you by using your reaction to dis

miss the spectral mind, using its magic to save your

self. Then roll 3d6. The spellbook temporarily loses

spells of your choice that have a combined spell

level equal to that roll or higher. For example, if the

roll's total is 9, spells vanish from the book that have

a combined level of at least 9, which could mean one

9th-level spell, three 3rd-level spells, or some other

combination. If there aren't enough spells in the

book to cover this cost, you drop to O hit points.

Until you finish ld6 long rests, you are incapable

of casting the lost spells, even if you find them on a

scroll or in another spellbook. After you finish the

required number of rests, the spells reappear in the

spell book.

Once you use this reaction, you can't do so again

until you finish a long rest.

You can conjure forth the mind of your Awakened

Spellbook. As a bonus action while the book is on

your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as

a Tiny spectral object, hovering in an unoccupied

space of your choice within 60 feet of you. The spec

tral mind is intangible and doesn't occupy its space,

and it sheds dim light in a l0-foot radius. It looks

like a ghostly tome, a cascade of text, or a scholar

from the past (your choice).

While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and

see, and it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

The mind can telepathically share with you what it

sees and hears (no action required).

Whenever you cast a wizard spell on your turn,

you can cast it as if you were in the spectral mind's

space, instead of your own, using its senses. You

can do so a number of times per day equal to your

proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses

when you finish a long rest.

As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral

mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space

that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures

but not objects.

The spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever

more than 300 feet away from you, if someone casts

dispel magic on it, if the Awakened Spellbook is

destroyed, if you die, or if you dismiss the spectral

mind as a bonus action.

Once you conjure the mind, you can't do so again

until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a

spell slot of any level to conjure it again.

You've learned some of an artificer's inventiveness:

You gain proficiency with one type of artisan's

tools of your choice, and you can use that type of

tool as a spellcasting focus for any spell you cast

that uses Intelligence as its spellcasting ability.

to a maximum of 20.

You gain proficiency with cook's utensils if you

As part of a short rest, you can cook special food,

provided you have ingredients and cook's utensils

on hand. You can prepare enough of this food for a

number of creatures equal to 4 + your proficiency

who eats the food and spends one or more Hit

You've learned how to exert your will on your spells

to alter how they function:

You learn two Metamagic options of your choice

from the sorcerer class. You can use only one

of materials, you can create a number of doses

of potent poison equal to your proficiency bonus.

Once applied to a weapon or piece of ammunition,

the poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until

damage and become poisoned until the end of

changed you, granting you the following benefits:

CHAPTER 2

GROUP PATRONS

ACH ADV ENTURIN G GRO UP IS BO UND

together by the quests it embarks on and

by the dangers its members face together.

This chapter offers another way to bind

your party together: a group patron. These patrons

provide a strong binding element: an individual or

an organization that unites a party as a team in ser

vice to a greater purpose. A group patron can help

set the tone of your party's entire campaign. For

example, a group whose patron is an academic insti

tution is likely to have a very different story from a

group that serves a military. A patron can influence

characters' relationships, their backstories, and the

types of dangers they face.

During character creation, every player has the

opportunity to weave connections between their

character and the other members of their party.

Rather than (or in addition to) creating a web of es

tablished relationships, players can work with the

DM to choose a group patron. And if you're inter

ested in being your own patron, see the "Being Your

Own Patron" section at the end of the chapter.

HOW PATRONS WORK

The following sections present several group patron

options. The description of each patron provides

an overview of the types of organizations the group

patron represents, perks of membership, and quests

the patron encourages adventurers to undertake.

With the input of your DM, you can customize

these patrons to reflect specific establishments in

your campaign world or to serve as a launchpad

tailored for organizations of your design. For ex

ample, the guild group patron could represent the

Harpers or the Zhentarim of the Forgotten Realms,

the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild in Eberron, or a

homebrew league of caravan guards. Or perhaps a

criminal syndicate, military force, or other category

of patron better fits the party's goals. Choose and

customize the group patron that works best for

your party and the types of adventures you want

to explore.

GROUP ASSISTANCE

J

T

O =

Having a group patron gives an adventuring group

a common purpose, which inspires better coordina

tion in the form of guidance and encouragement. As

a result of this unity,  each member of the party can

grant advantage to an ability check, an attack roll, or

a saving throw of another member of the party. To

grant advantage in this way, a character and the cho

sen target must be able to see or hear each other,

and neither can be incapacitated. Once a party

member grants this advantage, that individual can't

do so again until they finish a long rest.

PERKS

A group patron offers your party a number of perks

for your service. These range from standard busi

ness arrangements, such as a steady wage and ac

cess to staff facilities, to extraordinary boons, such

as audiences with powerful figures or exceptions

from certain laws. Specific perks are presented in

the description of each group patron.

The DM should not feel limited to providing only

the perks noted in each group patron's description.

Patrons give a party access to solutions and support

they wouldn't have otherwise, and a patron can use

their varied resources to guide their agents or pre

pare them for greater adventures.

ASSIGNMENTS

Your group's patron occasionally offers you an as

signment, a mission that provides a springboard for

adventure. Of course, it's up to you how you respond

to your patron's demands, and interesting stories

can result if you decide to refuse an assignment.

A more hands-off patron can still significantly

motivate your group. Maybe you seek adventures

based on what pleases your patron, possibly earning

status and rewards within your organization. An

academy, for example, might not organize particular

missions, so you hunt down ancient artifacts know

ing that your patron will reward you for bringing

them back. You have the freedom to chart your own

destiny, while letting the patron shape the nature of

your group and the adventures you undertake.

EX AMPLE PATRONS

Here are some of the most likely patrons for an ad

venturing group. Presented in alphabetical order,

these patrons can serve as inspiration for you to cre

ate patrons of your own:

----_j

The world's mysteries are innumerable, but you pur

sue them with vigor. As operatives for an academy,

you seek to unravel the secrets of existence and the

deeper riddles beyond.

In your work, you brush shoulders with the wisest

in the land, travel to places spoken of in myth, and

discover truths beyond imagining. Denying igno

rance, you pursue wondrous sights and endlessly

unearth new facts. Undiscovered creatures, the cov

etous dead, and jealous rivals impede your work, but

in the pursuit of knowledge, no risk is too great.

TYPES OF ACADEMIES

Any assemblage of scholars and truth-seekers can

function as an academy. Generally, an academy

unites a network of learned individuals, allowing

them to share their knowledge, further their re

search, and support common goals. Passing on wis

dom to the next generation is part of an academy's

mandate, but members find opportunities to under

take far-flung research expeditions-only so much

can be learned in libraries, after all. An academy's

focus can be broad or singular, artistic or scientific,

mundane or magical. For every topic with unex

plored possibilities, an academy seeks to plumb its

depths or elevate its study.

Roll or pick from the Academy Type table to deter

mine the institution with which you're aligned.

ACADEMY PERKS

With an academy as your group's patron, you gain

the following perks.

Compensation. The academy pays for the work

you do on its behalf. The nature of your employment

influences your compensation. On average, the

academy pays each member of your group 1 gp per

day, or enough to sustain a modest lifestyle. Alterna

tively, you receive a bounty (at least 250 gp) for each

artifact or relevant discovery you bring back from

your adventures and donate to the academy.

Documentation. Each member of your group has

identification denoting your affiliation with the acad

emy. This association carries clout in scholarly or

artistic circles. The academy also secures documen

tation, letters of introduction, and traveling papers

if your work requires them. Such documents grant

you special status, such as access to forbidden re

gions or neutral standing in embattled areas. Such

identification isn't always a boon, though. In a land

frequently plundered by foreigners, your documents

could mark you as nothing more than aggrandized

looters to some.

Research. Research is part of your group's job,

but your patron also has abundant resources to

facilitate such efforts. You can call in a favor to

delegate the work of researching lore (a downtime

activity described in the Player's Handbook and

Xanathar's Guide to Everything) to a colleague,

contact, librarian, or research assistant. You're re

sponsible for covering expenses incurred as part of

this research, and the DM determines its success

or failure.

Resources. Academies host libraries, museums,

record repositories, and training facilities, and you

can use them to further your work. You can call in a

favor from faculty members to access resources not

available to the public-dangerous relics or magic

items, spellbooks, gear, and the like. Additionally,

you can consult with the faculty of your academy as

the experts in various fields.

Training. Because you're associated with the

academy, you receive a discount on any education

you wish to pursue. When you undergo training as

a downtime activity (as described in the Player's

Handbook or Xanathar's Guide to Everything), you

pay half the normal cost, assuming the academy

teaches that subject. Training in languages, musical

instruments, and other tools is also available, at

the DM's discretion. In addition, you can gain pro

ficiency in the Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion

skills by this method, as if you were learning a lan

guage. A character can learn only one of these skills

in this way.

ACADEMY CONTACT

How much autonomy you have in choosing your

missions and how often you're expected to perform

on the academy's behalf depends largely on your

place in the institution's hierarchy. As students, new

professors, or support staff, you aid the work of a

senior professor or entire department. If you are fur

ther along in your career, you have your own goals

and assistants, but you still take on assignments to

further the goals of esteemed experts, deans, or the

academy as a whole. In any of these cases, a specific

contact manages your relationship to the academy.

Roll or pick from the Academy Contact table to de

termine who manages the relationship between you

and the academy.

ACADEMY CONTACT

d6  Contact

Harried Functionary. A disinterested secretary con

veys written correspondence to you from an excep

tionally busy or aloof senior faculty member.

2  Celebrated Instructor.  Despite their throngs of am

bitious assistants, a celebrity researcher considers

you their star pupil.

3  Wizened Fixture. A fantastically old, believed-to-be

deceased librarian gives you assignments from the

circulation desk they never leave.

4

Infatuated Tourist. A flirtatious visiting scholar per

ceives your every report and donated discovery as a

personal gift.

5

Spectral Fragment. A haunted piece of the acade

my's collection compels you to complete its secret

research.

6  Distant Observer. A mysterious sponsor encourages

your research from afar to avoid alerting nefarious

forces embedded within the academy's bureaucracy.

ACADEMY FACTOTUMS

If you have an academy as your patron, you are

likely engaged in a scholarly pursuit or support

someone who is. Consider being a promising stu

dent or a new member of the faculty. While you have

a modest course load that you handle behind the

scenes (or using any of a variety of downtime activi

ties), your primary interests involve aiding your con

tact in their research. Alternatively, you might work

to further the academy's efforts in another way, per

haps related to security or funding.

The Academy Factotum Roles table provides

suggestions for functions you perform within an

academy and the backgrounds frequently associated

with each role.

ACADEMY QUESTS

The focus of your study and the academy's research

defines the missions you undertake. Academics

struggle to keep one step ahead of their scholarly

rivals, making many of them suspicious of-even

hostile toward-other intellectuals. Beyond rivals

within their own profession, academics face chal

lenges from their subjects (whether members of

lost civilizations or magical beings) or suspicious

anti-intellectuals. Not everyone wants to be the sub

ject of scholarly scrutiny or thinks that solving the

world's mysteries is important or desirable.

The Academy Quests table presents a few of the

sort of endeavors your work or studies lead you to

undertake.

ACADEMY QUESTS

d6  Quest

Aberrant Zoology. You undertake expeditions to

document,  capture,  and explain beings antithetical

to the natural order.

2  Arcanodynamics. You investigate the ways magic

underpins existence,  exploring its flows and seeking

ways to harness its nexuses.

3

Forbidden History. You reveal the lost truths of the

world's darkest ages, pursuing the history of pur

posefully hidden or taboo eras.

4

Cryptogeography. You search for proof of a hidden

land or that the world isn't structured as commonly

assumed.

5

Restorative Antiquarianism. You track clues leading

to plundered artifacts and then restore them to

their rightful owners.

6

Evolutionary Divinity. You dare to explore what no

mortal was meant to know: the origins of divinity.

CHAPTER 2  ]  GROUP PATRONS

d6  Ancient Being

5  The Endless. This person has lived many lifetimes

because they can't die-at least not permanently.

No matter the cause of their demise, they return. To

all appearances, they are alive and mortal, but they

control the amassed resources of an immortal.

6

Primal  Manifestation. Its existence defies mortal

understanding; the being simply is.  It could be a pri

mordial force of nature awakened to self-awareness

that now inhabits the landscape or an alien intellect

that whispers through proxies, omens, and idols.

ANCIENT BEING PERKS

With the ancient being as your group's patron, you

gain the following perks.

Equipment. Your patron's network has access

to certain magic items. You can purchase common

magic items from your patron contact. The DM de

termines the available stock or can call for a group

Intelligence (Investigation) check to ascertain if the

ancient being's network can successfully locate a

desired item. The DC for this check is 10 in a city,

15 in a town, and 20 in a village. If the check fails,

ld8 days must pass before the same item can be

searched for again in that community.

The DM sets the price of a common magic item

or determines it randomly: 2d4 x 10 gp, or half

as much for a consumable item such as a potion

or scroll.

Research. Relying on an ancient being's network

of contacts, the being's vast collection of lore, or per

haps the being's direct teaching helps you unearth

hidden secrets. If you can contact your patron or

their agents, your group makes ability checks made

to research lore related to your patron's interests

and influence with advantage.

Sanctuary. Your patron's agents have safe houses

or other secure gatherings spread across a wide re

gion. Your group knows how to locate these friendly

enclaves and can maintain a modest lifestyle in one

for no cost. In return, you must defend the sanctu

ary or protect the secret of its existence.

Strange Gifts. Your patron grants your group a

small measure of esoteric power. At 5th level, and

again at 13th, you gain one supernatural gift as de

scribed in the treasure chapter of the Dungeon Mas

ter's Guide. The DM determines which supernatural

gifts are available.

ANCIENT BEING QUESTS

Though their work remains mysterious, ancient be

ings send their agents to exact their will in myriad

ways. Servants of other powerful beings try to sty

mie your patron's plans, while misguided (or entirely

justified) monster hunters seek to rid the world of

their ancient foe. An ancient being's lengthy history

inspires unusual and potent enemies.

The Ancient Being Quests table presents a

few options for the sorts of work your patron ex

pects from you.

ANCIENT BEING QUESTS

d6  Quest

Rescue. A wayward agent went missing while gath

ering information or materials. You must discover

their fate and recover them and their findings.

2

Sabotage. You must destroy an aspect of a rival's

organization, either assassinating a key minion or

destroying a critical object.

3  Artifice, Your specialized skills are instrumental to

assembling components for a powerful magic ritual

or object.

4  Treachery. A high-profile minion of another power

ful figure is in a position to betray their master, to

the benefit of your patron. You must convince them

to defect to your organization or extract them from

now-hostile territory.

5  Culling. A respected agent of your patron (possibly

an ally or a mentor for your group) has been com

promised. Perhaps they are defecting to a rival,

attempting to seize the ancient being's power.

Whatever the case, you must catch them to end

their threat.

6  Astral Heist. A powerful  rival of your patron stores

their secrets in a mind vault on the Astral Plane.

That means they can't be tricked or coerced into

revealing anything, nor can their thoughts be read.

You must find the vault and travel through the ri

val's deadly memories to find the knowledge your

patron desires.

d6  Contact

3  Magical Message Drop. Magically recorded mes

sages from your contact or your patron appear in

odd places. You know to check a predetermined

location, such as a crack in an ancient monolith or a

specific grave, for instructions.

4  Visions. Your patron doesn't use intermediaries, in

stead speaking to you in dreams, omens, or visions.

The being appears in your mind as you sleep, taking

control of your dreams to deliver instructions that

become difficult to ignore.

5

Ephemeral Echo. Your contact never physically re

veals itself to you. Perhaps it is the ghost of a dead

person, an entity that appears outside the flow of

time, or a projected illusion of a being that never

leaves your patron's hidden sanctum.

6  The Mouthpiece. The ancient being's voice whispers

through the lips of an ordinary person. You patron

might posses the body of a stranger or a party

member to converse with you.

ANCIENT BEING OPERATIVES

Consider the overarching goals of your group's an

cient being patron when determining who they re

cruit as agents. In what arenas does that being likely

hold sway? A powerful lich recruits other ambitious

spellcasters, as well as skilled warriors to serve as

bodyguards. A dragon values socially adept agents

and those who influence society's decision-makers.

Consider how your capabilities and interests align

directly with those of the ancient being, or how you

unwittingly fell into the patron's service.

The Ancient Being Operative Roles table suggests

a variety of parts you can play within an ancient

being's schemes and the backgrounds frequently

associated with each role.

Your group serves at the pleasure of a member of

the nobility. Motivated by money, power, and pol

agenda without dirtying their hands, or perhaps

they send you to the palaces of their enemies as en

your patron is a powerful ally whose favor bestows

far more than gold.

TYPES OF ARISTOCRATS

From the heads of scheming merchant families

to immortal sorcerer-queens, each member of the

aristocracy holds a measure of wealth and power

and they desire more. The rulers of a barony could

ARISTOCRAT PERKS

With an aristocrat as your group's patron, you gain

the following perks.

Expenses. Your patron reimburses you for ex

traordinary expenses incurred as part of your work.

You are required to account for your expenses and

must explain any extraordinary expenditures, but

routine travel, ordinary equipment, and basic ser

vices don't draw a second glance.

Immunity. As long as you remain in the aristo

crat's good graces, you are nearly immune to prose

cution under the laws within the aristocrat's sphere

of influence. When you are carrying out your orders,

you have a great deal of leeway in how you choose to

go about that, and the law isn't an obstacle. Commit

ting serious crimes-especially if they are unrelated

or unnecessary for the assigned work-is a sure way

to fall out of your patron's good graces, however.

Luxury. Your patron deigns to host you at their

home or in other luxurious accommodations for a

brief period as reward for a job well done. Such a

stay typically lasts for no longer than two weeks per

year, during which you maintain an aristocratic life

style for no cost. You must defend the locale if nec

essary, but you're largely afforded time to relax as

you please. However, poor (or outright destructive)

guests rarely receive invitations to stay again.

CHAPTER 2  ]  GROUP PATRONS

Salary. Your employment under an aristocratic

patron brings an income of 1 gp per day, or enough

to maintain a modest lifestyle. At the DM's discre

tion, your salary increases or decreases depending

on the aristocrat's nature, the type of work, and the

length of your employment.

ARISTOCRAT CONTACT

Aside from a few exceptions, aristocrats prefer to

have someone else handle communication with the

hired help. As a result, you communicate with an

intermediary who serves as a go-between in your

dealings with your patron.

TYPES OF CRIMINAL SYNDICATES

Criminal syndicates range from the local thieves'

guild, to a corrupt consortium of merchant princes,

to a ring of otherworldly invaders infiltrating all

levels of society for a nefarious purpose. Whatever

form it takes, the syndicate is largely concerned

with increasing wealth for its members at the ex

pense of society at large,

Conversely,  the syndicate could be an under

ground organization of good-hearted people fight

ing against a wicked power structure. Criminal

syndicates with a heroic bent include the band of

plucky outlaws who hijack taxes from the cruel

baron and return them to the downtrodden and a

hard-bitten ring of deserters who fight their home

land's invaders.

Roll or pick from the Syndicate Types table to

determine what type of criminal organization

you serve.

SYNDICATE  TYPES

d6  Syndicate

Thieves' Guild. A disparate convocation of thieves,

spies, smugglers, and other scoundrels controls

criminal activity in a region of a city.

2  Assassin Society. The network's livelihood is death.

Members of the society hone their skills as cut

throats, poisoners, body-disposal specialists, and

any other profession focused on ending lives. The

society is motivated by profit or labors in service to

a greater cause.

3  Magical Arms Dealer. The syndicate has cornered

the market on deadly magical devices. They offer

their services and wares for a price and acquire

staggering magical might for those who meet their

demands.

4

Pirate Fleet. This alliance of pirate captains is uni

fied under a ruling captain or admiral and adheres

to a strict code of honor. They converge only in re

sponse to an outside threat.

5

Body Snatchers. The syndicate consists predomi

nantly,  if not entirely,  of creatures that possess or

impersonate other people. They seek to replace

influential individuals throughout society with mem

bers of their ranks.

Thought Thieves. These psychic criminals infiltrate

their target's minds to steal secrets and disguise

their existence.

iwto, a toad?

TASHA

A network of criminals employs your group. You

could be full-fledged members in good standing

with the syndicate or probationary inductees look

ing to make your mark and earn its trust. Perhaps

your group works for the syndicate against your will:

you owe them big for a job gone wrong, for killing

the wrong person, or simply for being born into a

family that's already in conflict with powerful, un

scrupulous people.

CRIMINAL SYNDICATE PERKS

With the criminal syndicate as your group's patron,

you gain the following perks.

Assignments. The syndicate doesn't pay you

directly, but it assigns you to particular tasks on

behalf of its clients or the organization. Someone

hires the syndicate to perform a task (such as an

assassination), and the syndicate passes 85 percent

of the fee on to your group. If the aim is to enrich

the syndicate (such as by pulling off a heist), you

have the privilege of keeping 85 percent of what you

steal. Other syndicates take more or less than a 15

percent share, at the DM's discretion.

Contraband. You have access to your syndicate's

business in contraband, such as poisons or narcot

ics. You don't receive a discount on these goods, but

you can always find someplace to purchase them.

Fences. Members or associates of your syndi

cate are skilled at disposing of stolen goods, and

you have access to this service as well. Fences

are useful for selling not just illicit goods but also

expensive items such as works of art and magic

items. In the case of magic items, this allows you to

delegate the work of finding a buyer (a downtime ac

tivity described in the Dungeon Master's Guide and

Xanathar's Guide to Everything) to the fence. When

using the syndicate's fences, you run no risk of a

double-cross or other mishap in finding a buyer, but

the syndicate takes 20 percent of the sale price as a

finder's fee.

Safe Houses. The syndicate maintains safe

houses or other secret hiding spots across a wide

region. Your group knows how to locate these non

descript redoubts and can maintain a poor lifestyle

in one for no cost. Revealing a safe house, whether

purposefully or by accident, causes you to lose favor

with the syndicate and may see you banned from

using them.

Syndicate-Owned Businesses. The syndicate

owns several businesses, primarily as fronts for

laundering money. When you buy from one of these

businesses, you get a 5 percent discount. The DM

decides what goods and services are available,

CRIMINAL SYNDICATE CONTACT

Each member of the syndicate has a place in the

organization. You report to a contact who handles

your contribution by giving you assignments, collect

ing the syndicate's cut of your swag, or seeing that

you receive your fee for contract work from outside

clients. The contact is your first point of communica

tion if you need to reach out to highly ranked mem

bers of the syndicate's hierarchy.

Whether you're a lifelong scoundrel or an ambi

Your group has ties to a powerful consortium of

professionals who work together for mutual benefit.

You might be long-time members of such a guild, de

which you inherited membership, or perhaps you're

working to earn entrance on your own merits. If you

serve the guild's interests well, it promises to take

care of you. Guilds hate to waste valuable assets,

after all-that's just bad business.

TYPES OF GUILD

The guild structure covers a swath of business ven

tures, differentiated by their specialty. A conglom

erate of blacksmiths, jewelers, carpenters, tailors,

alchemists, scribes, and sages all could organize as

a guild. Whatever their trade, these experts share

contacts, exchange resources such as materials or

tools, and leverage their collective influence to affect

politics for their benefit. Alternatively, merchants

and other business owners might also organize into

guilds. Merchant barons who effectively rule a city

or nation through iron-clad control of the economy

or a network of innkeepers who share news and

supply routes could both represent guild patrons.

A guild could even embody a more sinister group,

such as one that deals in terrifying wares like

deadly monsters, dangerous knowledge, or souls.

Roll or pick from the Guild Types table to deter

ate within.

GUILD TYPES

Crafters' Guild. This conglomerate of artisans pools

its resources and influence to ensure a steady ex

2  Merchant Consortium. These entrepreneurs don't

create the wares they peddle, instead specializing in

linking products to prospective owners. If they don't

have it, they find it.

3  Miracle Makers' Association. The magically inclined

crafters of this guild specialize in imbuing physical

goods with magical effects. Rumor has it they can

strip the magic from existing enchanted items and

might be willing to buy or trade adventurers' spoils.

4  Moneychangers. These merchants deal  in all forms

GUILD PERKS

With a guild as your group's patron, you gain the

following perks. These perks require an annual

contribution of 15 gp paid to the guild (replacing the

5 gp per month cost for characters with the Guild

Artisan background). These dues fund the guild's

services and activities.

Accommodations. You can stay at your organi

zation's guildhall. The rooms are comparable to

those in a comfortable inn, but at a modest price (5

op per day).

Equipment. You can requisition the use of spe

cialized tools, laboratories, libraries, or other craft

ing space and equipment to use within the guildhall.

When you make an ability check with a set of arti

san's tools using the guild's equipment, add double

your normal proficiency bonus to the check.

Resources. You can leverage the guild's exten

sive contacts to locate exotic materials for crafting,

spell components, or magic items, or buyers for

them (a downtime activity in the Dungeon Master's

Guide and Xanathar's Guide to Everything). You

can locate or sell legal commodities using the

guild's resources, and any prices tip in your favor by

10 percent.

Training. The guild retains knowledgeable tutors

in subjects pertinent to its interests. When you un

dertake the training downtime activity (as described

in the Player's Handbook and Xanathar's Guide to

Everything), the training takes half as long if you

are studying a subject the guild specializes in. The

DM decides if the guild has tutors available for a

given subject.

GUILD  CONTACT

Even as a member in good standing of the guild,

you can't simply stroll up to the guild master and

demand their attention. Your superiors within the

guild manage work contracts, request the use of

guild resources, and facilitate getting your group

in contact with the right people to assist their

interests.

The Perfectionist. Your contact is a skilled but ob

sessive creator consumed with the quest to create

something perfect that will define their life's work

and secure their legacy. They lose sight of right and

wrong in pursuit of the finest materials and exciting

opportunities.

2  Attentive Overseer. A guild representative takes

personal  interest in your group's tasks. They follow

your exploits and know of your adventures before

you return to report. Despite the unsettling depth

of their knowledge, they seem genuinely eager to

shepherd your work.

3  Hidden Benefactor. Whoever your contact is, they

don't communicate directly.  They send messages

via couriers or letters.  No one in the guild knows

who the contact is, or if they do, they aren't telling

you.  Regardless, the contact's information is good,

and they pay on time.

4  Discerning Mentor.  No matter how well you per

form, or how perfect your creations,  nothing is ever

good enough for this contact. They point out every

flaw and missed opportunity.  Are they bitter,  lashing

out at anyone around them, or do they recognize

your potential and try to push you to greatness?

5  Golem Guide. Your guild contact is the soul of a

long-dead artisan preserved in a construct body.

This golem is wise and knowledgeable, but it has

difficulty grasping the passage of time and the state

of the world compared to its original era.

6

Fallen Muse. Your contact is a fallen celestial.

Whether they regret their transgressions or hunger

for vengeance, they provide divine inspiration and

guidance to you and to the guild.  Somehow your

group and the guild inspire their hope for ascension.

GUILD REPRESENTATIVES

As a guild member, you might be a professional

who works directly toward the guild's specialty or

whose fortunes align with the guild's interests. Al

ternatively, you could provide the guild with services

to which their members aren't suited. For example,

guards, explorers, negotiators, and spies can be

useful to a guild, whether its interests lie in trade

goods, entertainment, or more questionable ven

tures. Whether a guild operates entirely within the

law and how public its interests are also influences

which of your skills it deems most valuable.

MILITARY FORCE TYPES

d6  Military Organization

Standing Army. A standing army serves as the highly

disciplined and structured guardian of a province

or an entire nation. Strict tiers of command ensure

coordination between branches of the force.

2  Mercenary Company.  Hard-bitten veterans of nu

merous conflicts, mercenaries serve an employer

for coin rather than out of loyalty.

3

Expeditionary Force. This military force is far from

home, fighting behind enemy lines or striking

into wild, unsettled lands. The force must be fast,

self-sufficient, and either diplomatic or decisive to

assure their survival.

4  Horde. The horde is almost a force of nature, and

S

what it lacks in discipline it makes up in ferocity.  It

doesn't have a rigid command structure, instead

functioning like a pyramid of smaller armies. Horde

commanders owe fealty to stronger leaders above

them, all the way up to the warlord.

Planar Conscripts. This military force battles for cos

mic stakes on far-flung planes of the multiverse or

fights against extraplanar invasion on the Material

Plane. Warriors include conscripts pressed into ser

vice in the Blood War, fodder in the thrall of ruthless

yugoloth mercenaries, or members of a glorious ce

lestial host defending against fiendish incursion.

6  Sky Warriors. This military force consists of winged

creatures, employs magical flight, or sails airships

as a sky navy. Traditional defenses are ineffective

against attacks from the air, positioning the sky war

riors as a fearsome nation or expensive and coveted

mercenaries.

MILITARY FORCE PERKS

With a military force as your group's patron, you

gain the following perks.

Armory. You can purchase nonmagical weapons

and armor at a 20 percent discount at a facility

associated with your military force. You can buy

magic items at the DM's discretion, but you receive

no discount.

Chain of Command. You are part of a hierarchy

that provides you with orders. If you cause trouble

in your own nation, you answer to your officers, not

local law enforcement.

OJlicial Access. Your rank in the military force

grants you access to places that are off limits to

civilians. With your commander's permission, you

can enter dangerous training grounds or military in

stallations, like an army's regional headquarters or

you fail, you'll become part of the collection.

Salary. Each member of your group earns a regtu

amount varies depending on your organization and

your position within it, but at minimum you enjoy a

modest lifestyle. You receive a small salary (as little

money for room and board. With higher rank comes

higher pay. As an officer, you maintain a comfortable

RELIGIOUS ORDER

Sure, Serve that reliqiouy  order, ad {oow you'll be

because-- coveiewtlu----it's divie will.

Your group acts in the service of a religious institu

tion. The patronage of a religious order isn't simply

a matter of each member of your party belonging to

the same faith, though. The faith's administration

with its own resources, goals, and leaders-directly

sponsors and guides your adventures.

TYPES OF RELIGIOUS ORDERS

Not every religious order represents an alliance of

worshipers devoted to godly ideals. Perhaps your

group is a team of devotees pursuing a cause for

your faith, or maybe you're a bunch of cynics taking

advantage of a wealthy congregation. Your collec

tive faith could compel you to hunt evil monsters or

stave off otherworldly invasions, to protect the pow

erless from oppression, or to spread the teachings of

your religion in a hostile land. Or perhaps you serve

a corrupt hierarchy by making its enemies quietly

disappear-though even cynical mercenaries can

become true believers when confronted with the

miraculous.

Roll or pick from the Religious Order Types table

to determine the type of religious patron you serve.

RELIGIOUS ORDER TYPES

d6  Religious Order

Undead Hunters. This community of scholars and

monster hunters laboriously researches the unquiet

dead, tracking them to their lairs and permanently

laying them to rest.

2  Devout Scholars. This federation prizes knowl

edge and texts pertaining to their god. They col

lect rare holy books and record the life stories of

miracle-working prophets.

3

Relic Collectors. This order of archaeologist-monks

seeks to fill their museum-like temple with storied

holy relics.

4  Charitable Missionaries. Adhering to the belief that

religion empowers civilization, this order travels far

to help the downtrodden, seeking to draw new be

lievers by their virtuous example.

5  Militant Inquisitors. This dogmatically rigid hierar

chy seeks to stamp out all threats to their beliefs.

6  Doomsaying Evangelists. This order believes the

world is about to end. They're convinced that if they

persuade everyone else of this fact they might stave

off the impending doom.

RELIGIOUS ORDER PERKS

With a religious order as your group's patron, you

gain the following perks.

Divine Service. In times of need, your group can

appeal to the priests of your faith for magical aid.

An NPC cleric or druid of your faith who is of suf

ficiently high level casts any spell of up to 5th level

on your group's behalf, without charge. The caster

provides any costly material components needed for

the spell, as long as you demonstrate your need and

are in good standing with the faith.

CHAPTER 2  ]  GROUP PATRONS

Equipment. Each member of your party has a

holy symbol or druidic focus, even if it isn't needed

for spellcasting. Each of you also has a book con

taining prayers, rites, and scriptures of your faith.

Proficiencies. Each member of your party gains

proficiency in the Religion skill, if the character

doesn't already have it.

RELIGIOUS  ORDER CONTACT

Your established order enjoys a robust following. It

might be a cloister of priestly scholars who use your

group as the adventuring arm of the organization,

or perhaps a legion of paladins who call on your

group's finesse where swords and shields fail. You

might receive orders directly from the immortal

entity you worship or through an earthly agent, such

as a high priest or an archdruid.

Roll or pick from the Religious Order Contact ta

RELIGIOUS ORDER QUESTS

The services you provide your religious order vary

depending on the deity you serve and your party's

aptitudes. Regardless, religious orders are opposed

by antagonistic faiths, foes whose rivalry with your

order emulates the conflict between your respective

gods. Some religious orders also hunt and destroy

fiends, undead, or other beings they consider abom

inations, seeking to rid the word of their influence.

Others root out heretics, real or imagined, to

demonstrate the primacy of their deity.

The Religious Order Quests table presents a

few examples of how you can honor and serve

your deity.

SOVEREIGN

I  ever had uch iwterest i rulinq, partly because

tke titles all oud So stu[{y. But "with quee" ha$  a

lovely ria to it, do't you thik?

TAMA

A leader without allies is not long a leader. You

serve a sovereign-a national figure or otherwise

and work to achieve their goals no matter the cost.

As agents of a sovereign, you serve as diplomats

or enforcers, spies or fixers, bringers of aid or exec

utors of justice. You work within the system to up

hold the status quo or step beyond the law to prevent

war and worse. Politics, espionage, and mystery are

facts of your world, as is hope and the fragile prom

ise of peace.

TYPES OF SOVEREIGNS

Broadly defined, a sovereign ranges from the head

of a government to the leader of a powerful, private

institution. Queens, chieftains, sultans, and rajahs

are ready choices for powerful individuals who pa

tronize a party of adventurers. Those on track to be

come such individuals-such as cunning senators,

royal heirs, or influential celebrities-also fill a sov

ereign's role. When choosing or creating a sovereign

to serve, consider whether that leader commands a

government organization or another faction. While

(1,IOO~  CHAPTER 2  I  GROUP PATRONS



this section assumes your patron is the head of a 

country or other national body, they could oversee

a powerful private division, a cult of personality, or

an elaborate expedition. Also, consider the scale of

your patron's organization. While serving as spies

engaging in international intrigues could lead to

world-changing escapades, being fixers for the

mayor of a struggling town offers a personal con

nection to a place and its people.

Roll or pick from the Sovereign Types table to de

termine what sort of liege you serve.

SOVEREIGN TYPES

d6  Sovereign

l

Village Elder. The wizened leader of a community

offers both civic and moral leadership.

2

Young Noble. An ambitious noble eagerly seeks to

reform society to align with a personal  vision.

3

Shipwrecked Governor. A desperate leader struggles

to keep people alive in a wilderness they're not pre

pared to endure.

4

Ruler Returned. A tribe's revered leader has re

turned from the dead and seeks to resurrect their

past glories.

S

Hidden Power. A mysterious figure manipulates the

nation's puppet leader and guides the government's

true agenda.

6

True Regent. The rightful  heir to the throne strug

gles to reclaim power from a perfect impostor.

SOVEREIGN PERKS

With the sovereign as your group's patron, you gain

the following perks.

Elite Access. While in service to the sovereign,

you have access to the highest echelons of society.

With your patron's permission, you can gain access

to the halls of power, from national capitols and

military headquarters to noble estates and troves

of state secrets. You can also request that the sov

ereign grant you access to perks of their position,

like access to diplomatic receptions or use of the

royal guards.

Expenses. Your patron reimburses you for ex

traordinary expenses incurred as part of your work.

You are required to account for your expenses and

must explain any extraordinary expenditures, but

routine travel, ordinary equipment, and basic ser

vices don't draw a second glance.

Immunity. As long as you remain in the sov

ereign's good graces, you are nearly immune to

prosecution under the laws within their sphere of

influence. When you are carrying out your orders,

you have a great deal of leeway in how you choose to

go about that, and the law isn't an obstacle. Commit

ting serious crimes-especially if they are unrelated

or unnecessary for the assigned work-is a sure way

to fall out of your patron's good graces, however.

Salary. Your employment under a sovereign pa

tron brings an income of 1 gp per day, or enough to

maintain a modest lifestyle. At the DM's discretion,

your salary increases or decreases depending on

the sovereign's nature, the type of work you per

form, and the length of your employment.

SOVEREIGN CONTACT

You might benefit from direct contact with your

group patron. This includes audiences or secret

meetings with the sovereign, depending on the na

ture of your work. Alternatively, the sovereign might

purposefully want to keep their distance from you,

either due to their busy schedules or to maintain

plausible deniability regarding your work. In such

cases, an advisor or functionary oversees your as

signments, serving as the primary contact between

you and the sovereign.

SOVEREIGN QUESTS

The services you provide a sovereign largely depend

on the nature of your group patron and their nation.

While some of your missions involve official tasks

missions undertaken in the sovereign's name-oth

ers might be covert, making your patron's identity a

highly guarded secret. Political rivals, enemy coun

tries, and natural disasters all pose dangers to the

sovereign's nation. Yet a sovereign who sows chaos,

enacts tyrannical decrees, or jeopardizes a popu

lation's way of life is likely to inspire rebellions. In

such cases, a sovereign's agents must decide where

their loyalties lie.

The Sovereign Quests table presents a few of the

sorts of missions you undertake for your liege.

Spectral Assembly. A ghostly council of the nation's

d6  Quest

SOVEREIGN PROXIES

You serve a sovereign out of national pride, out of

tradition, or for your own practical reasons. The

needs of a leader potentially embroil you directly in

political intrigues, court maneuverings, or threats

from national foes. It's up to you and the sovereign

to determine whether your work is publicly acknowl

edged or top secret-and if the latter, what happens

if your work is exposed.

The Sovereign Proxy Roles table suggests ways

you might serve a sovereign and the backgrounds

frequently associated with each role.

International Espionage. You attempt to steal intelli

gence,  national symbols, or super weapons from an

enemy power.

2  Undermine Rival. You seek to weaken or remove

a  rival to the regent's rule-perhaps a general, an

archdruid, or a  noble with a claim to the throne.

3

Expel Corruption. You help the sovereign reform

their government,  rooting out institutional vices.

4

Subvert Blame. The sovereign is caught in an em

barrassing affair.  Make it disappear.

5

Test Heir. You prepare the sovereign's heir for the

challenge of taking the throne.

6  Desperate Diplomacy. You seek to make peace with

a force or entity that could wipe out your nation.

CHAPTER 2 I  GROUP PATRONS

BEING YOUR OWN PATRON

For some players, the idea of running a crime syn

dicate, mercenary company, arcane scholars' collec

tive, or other organization is far more exciting than

working for someone else. Founding your own orga

nization offers a greater degree of autonomy, though

potentially at the cost of support and reliable work.

When you're the boss, the perks of belonging to

an organization become expenses you have to worry

about; when you run your own mercenary company,

for example, you need to stock your own armory,

rather than drawing on an existing organization's

stockpile. The organization brings in income,

but you'll have to spend it to keep the organiza

tion running.

When you run your own organization, use the

Running a Business downtime activity (described in

the Dungeon Master's Guide) to reflect your organi

zation's ongoing activities. More than one character

can take part in this activity at a time. When rolling

to determine the business's performance, add the

total days spent by the characters to the roll to de

termine the business's success (still observing the

maximum of 30). If the business earns a profit, mul

tiply that profit by 4 + the number of characters who

took part in this downtime activity.

Don't discount the value of adopting an NPC to

scrvc as your contact within your own organization.

A secretary, majordomo, or apprentice keeps up

with your group's bureaucracy while you're con

ducting missions and passes along information that

could lead to your next adventure!

SPELL DESCRIPTIONS

The spells are presented in alphabetical order.

BLADE OF DISASTER

9th-level conjuration

Casting Time: 1 bonus action

Range: 60 feet

Components: V,  S

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a blade-shaped planar rift about 3 feet

long in an unoccupied space you can see within

range. The blade lasts for the duration. When you

cast this spell, you can make up to two melee spell

attacks with the blade, each one against a creature,

loose object, or structure within 5 feet of the blade.

On a hit, the target takes 4d12 force damage. This

attack scores a critical hit if the number on the d20

is 18 or higher. On a critical hit, the blade deals

an extra 8dl2 force damage (for a total of 12d12

force damage).

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the

blade up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can

see and then make up to two melee spell attacks

with it again.

The blade can harmlessly pass through any bar

rier, including a wall of force.

BOOMING BLADE

Evocation cantrip

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self (5-foot radius)

Components: S, M (a melee weapon worth at

least 1 sp)

Duration: 1 round

You brandish the weapon used in the spell's cast

ing and make a melee attack with it against one

creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target

suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and then

becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start

of your next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet

or more before then, the target takes ld8 thunder

damage, and the spell ends.

This spell's damage increases when you reach

certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an

extra ld8 thunder damage to the target on a hit, and

the damage the target takes for moving increases to

2d8. Both damage rolls increase by ld8 at 11th level

(2d8 and 3d8) and again at 17th level (3d8 and 4d8).

DREAM OF THE BLUE VEIL

7th-level conjuration

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: 20 feet

Components: V, S, M (a magic item or a willing

creature from the destination world)

Duration: 6 hours

TRAVELING TO OTHER WORLDS

The Material Plane holds an infinite number of worlds.

Some like Oerth, Toril, Krynn, and Eberror---are well

documented, but there are countless others. You and

your friends may even have created some homemade

D&D worlds yourselves!

It was not always so. Various scholars speak of a pri

mordial state, a single reality they call the First World,

which preceded the multiverse as we know it. Many

of the peoples and monsters that inhabit the worlds

in the Material Plane originated there. After the First

World was shattered by a great cataclysm-giving

birth to the worlds that came in its wake the progeny

of the first elves, dwarves, beholders, and other iconic

creatures took root on world after world, like seeds

scattered by a cosmic wind. If the musings of these

great sages are true, every world is a reflection- and

in some cases, a distortion-of the First World.

Transit between these worlds is rare but not im

possible and can be accomplished in various ways.

One such method is called the Great Journey, an epic

voyage fraught with peril and littered with obstacles to

be overcome. This journey most often occurs aboard a

vessel powered by magic.

Another method is the Dream of Other Worlds; trav

elers fall into a deep slumber and dream themselves

into a new realm. The spell dream of the blue veil em

ploys this method of transit.

The most direct method is the Leap to Another

Realm; a spellcaster casts teleportation circle or tele

port, aiming to appear in a known teleportation circle

or some other location in another world.

Whatever method you use to reach a world, the DM

determines whether you succeed and where exactly

you appear if you do arrive in that realm.

You and up to eight willing creatures within range

fall unconscious for the spell's duration and experi

ence visions of another world on the Material Plane,

such as Oerth, Toril, Krynn, or Eberron. If the spell

reaches its full duration, the visions conclude with

each of you encountering and pulling back a mys

terious blue curtain. The spell then ends with you

mentally and physically transported to the world

that was in the visions.

To cast this spell, you must have a magic item that

originated on the world you wish to reach, and you

must be aware of the world's existence, even if you

don't know the world's name. Your destination in the

other world is a safe location within 1 mile of where

the magic item was created. Alternatively, you can

cast the spell if one of the affected creatures was

born on the other world, which causes your destina

tion to be a safe location within 1 mile of where that

creature was born.

The spell ends early on a creature if that creature

takes any damage, and the creature isn't trans

ported. If you take any damage, the spell ends for

you and all the other creatures, with none of you

being transported.

CHAPTERS] MAGICAL MISCELLANY

GREEN-FLAME BLADE

Evocation cantrip

Casting Time: 1 action

ture within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers

the weapon attack's normal effects, and you can

cause green fire to leap from the target to a different

creature of your choice that you can see within 5

feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage

equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

This spell's damage increases when you reach

certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an

extra ldS fire damage to the target on a hit, and the

fire damage to the second creature increases to ldS

+ your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage

rolls increase by ldS at 11th level (2d8 and 2d8) and

17th level (3d8 and 3d8).

INTELLECT FORTRESS

3rd-level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

can see within range has resistance to psychic dam

age, as well as advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom,

and Charisma saving throws.

you target them.

LIGHTNING LURE

Evocation cantrip

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self (15-foot radius)

Components: V

Duration: Instantaneous

You create a lash of lightning energy that strikes

at one creature of your choice that you can see

within 15 feet of you. The target must succeed on a

Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet in a

straight line toward you and then take ld8 lightning

damage if it is within 5 feet of you.

This spell's damage increases by ld8 when you

reach 5th level (2d8),  11th level (3d8), and 17th

level (4d8).

M IND  SLIVER

Enchantment cant rip

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 60 feet

Components: V

Duration: 1 round

You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into

the mind of one creature you can see within range.

The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving

throw or take ld6 psychic damage and subtract ld4

from the next saving throw it makes before the end

of your next turn.

This spell's damage increases by ld6 when you

reach certain levels: 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6),

and 17th level (4d6).

SPIRIT SHROUD

3rd-level necromancy

Casting Time: 1 bonus action

Range: Self

Components: V,  S

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You call forth spirits of the dead, which flit around

you for the spell's duration. The spirits are intangi

ble and invulnerable.

Until the spell ends, any attack you make deals

ld8 extra damage when you hit a creature within 10

feet of you. This damage is radiant, necrotic, or cold

(your choice when you cast the spell). Any creature

that takes this damage can't regain hit points until

the start of your next turn.

In addition, any creature of your choice that you

can see that starts its turn within 10 feet of you has

its speed reduced by 10 feet until the start of your

next turn.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using

a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage in

creases by ld8 for every two slot levels above 3rd.

CHAPTER 3 I  MAGICAL MISCELLANY

SUMMON ABERRATION

4th-level conjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 90 feet

Components: V,  S, M (a pickled tentacle and an eye-

ball in a platinum-inlaid vial worth at least 400 gp)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth an aberrant spirit. It manifests in an

unoccupied space that you can see within range.

This corporeal form uses the Aberrant Spirit stat

block. When you cast the spell, choose Beholderkin,

Slaad, or Star Spawn. The creature resembles an

aberration of that kind, which determines certain

traits in its stat block. The creature disappears

when it drops to O hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your compan

ions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative

count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours.

It obeys your verbal commands (no action required

TASHA

Just as every performer lends their art a personal

flair and every warrior asserts their fighting styles

through the lens of their own training, so too can a

spellcaster use magic to express their individuality.

Regardless of what type of spell caster you're play

ing, you can customize the cosmetic effects of your

character's spells. Perhaps you wish the effects of

your caster's spells to appear in their favorite color,

to suggest the training they received from a celestial

mentor, or to exhibit their connection to a season

of the year. The possibilities for how you might

cosmetically customize your character's spells are

endless. However, such alterations can't change the

effects of a spell. They also can't make one spell

seem like another-you can't, for example, make a

magic missile look like a fireball.

When customizing your spellcaster's magic, con

sider developing a theme-often, the broader and

more versatile the better. You may describe your

caster's magic whenever you wish, particularly

when it makes an interesting addition to a story.

You may also use it to reinforce other choices you've

made for your character,  like making a bard's spells

tied more closely to their favored art form or a cler

ic's spells themed around their deity.

For example, the fireball of a wizard with a

fondness for storms might erupt to look like burn

ing clouds or a burst of red lightning (without

affecting the spell's damage type), while the same

wizard's haste spell might limn the target in faint

thunderheads.

Alternatively, a cleric who serves a moon god

might radiate faint moonlight around their hands

when they cast cure wounds, or their shield of faith

might surround the target with glimmering cres

cent moons.

Further still, a druid could choose a cherry

blossom theme for their magic, causing delicate

branches and pink leaves to grow when they cast en

tangle or shillelagh, and their faerie fire spell could

appear more like wind-tossed petals than flames.

The Magic Themes table offers just a few sugges

tions that might inspire you while personalizing

your character's spells.

Blending magic and artistry with ink and needles,

magic tattoos imbue their bearers with wondrous

abilities. Magic tattoos are initially bound to magic

needles, which transfer their magic to a creature.

Once inscribed on a creature's body, damage or

injury doesn't impair the tattoo's function, even if

the tattoo is defaced. When applying a magic tattoo,

a creature can customize the tattoo's appearance. A

magic tattoo can look like a brand, scarification, a

birthmark, patterns of scale, or any other cosmetic

alteration.

The rarer a magic tattoo is, the more space it typ

ically occupies on a creature's skin. The Magic Tat

too Coverage table offers guidelines for how large a

given tattoo is.

MAGIC ITEM DESCRIPTIONS

The following magic items are presented in alpha

betical order.

ABSORBING TATTOO

Wondrous item (tattoo), very rare (requires

attunement)

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo fea

tures designs that emphasize one color.

Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you

hold the needle to your skin where you want the tat

too to appear, pressing the needle there throughout

the attunement process. When the attunement is

complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes

the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo

vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

Damage Resistance. While the tattoo is on

your skin, you have resistance to a type of damage

associated with that color, as shown on the table

below. The DM chooses the color or determines

it randomly.

Damage Absorption. When you take damage of

the chosen type, you can use your reaction to gain

immunity against that instance of the damage, and

you regain a number of hit points equal to half the

damage you would have taken. Once this reaction is

used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

ALCHEMICAL COMPENDIUM

A/ondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a

wizard)

Acrid odors cling to this stained, heavy volume. The

book's metal fittings are copper, iron, lead, silver,

and gold, some frozen mid-transition from one

metal to another. When found, the book contains the

following spells: enlarge/reduce, feather fall, flesh to

stone, gaseous form, magic weapon, and polymorph.

It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as

a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains ld3 ex

pended charges daily at dawn. You can use the

charges in the following ways while holding it:

If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you

can expend 1 charge to replace one of your

prepared wizard spells with a different spell in

the book. The new spell must be of the trans

mutation school.

As an action, you can touch a nonmagical object

that isn't being worn or carried and spend a num

ber of charges to transform the target into another

object. For 1 charge, the object can be no larger

than 1 foot on a side. You can spend additional

charges to increase the maximum dimensions by

2 feet per charge. The new object must have a gold

value equal to or less than the original.

ALL-PURPOSE TOOL

Wondrous item, uncommon (+1), rare (+2),  very rare

(+3) (requires attunement by an artificer)

This simple screwdriver can transform into a vari

ety of tools; as an action, you can touch the item and

transform it into any type of artisan's tool of your

choice (see the "Equipment" chapter in the Player's

Handbook for a list of artisan's tools). Whatever

form the tool takes, you are proficient with it.

While holding this tool, you gain a bonus to the

spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your

artificer spells. The bonus is determined by the

tool's rarity.

As an action, you can focus on the tool to channel

your creative forces. Choose a cantrip that you don't

know from any class list. For 8 hours, you can cast

that cantrip, and it counts as an artificer cantrip

for you. Once this property is used, it can't be used

again until the next dawn.

AMULET OF THE DEVOUT

Wondrous item, uncommon (+1), rare (+2),  very rare

(+3) (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)

This amulet bears the symbol of a deity inlaid with

precious stones or metals. While you wear the holy

symbol, you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls and

the saving throw DCs of your spells. The bonus is

determined by the amulet's rarity.

While you wear this amulet, you can use your

Channel Divinity feature without expending one

of the feature's uses. Once this property is used, it

can't be used again until the next dawn.

CHAPTER 5  ]  MAGICAL MISCELLANY

II9

ARCANE GRIMOIRE

Wondrous item, uncommon (+l), rare (+2),  very rare

(+ 3) (requires attunement by a wizard)

While you are holding this leather-bound book, you

can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard

spells, and you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls and

to the saving throw DCs of your wizard spells. The

bonus is determined by the book's rarity.

You can use this book as a spellbook. In addition,

when you use your Arcane Recovery feature, you

can increase the number of spell slot levels you

regain by 1.

ASTRAL SHARD

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a

sorcerer)

This crystal is a solidified shard of the Astral Plane,

swirling with silver mist. As an action, you can at

tach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon

or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your

attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a

spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells while you

hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell

while you are holding or wearing the shard, imme

diately after casting the spell you can teleport to an

unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you.

ASTROM ANCY ARCHIVE

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a

wizard)

This brass disc of articulated, concentric rings un

folds into an armillary sphere. As a bonus action,

you can unfold it into the sphere or back into a disc.

When found, it contains the following spells, which

are wizard spells for you while you are attuned to

it: augury, divination, find the path, foresight, locate

creature, and locate object. It functions as a spell

book for you, with spells encoded on the rings.

While you are holding the archive, you can use it

as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The archive has 3 charges, and it regains ld3

expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the

charges in the following ways while holding it:

If you spend 1 minute studying the archive,

you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your

prepared wizard spells with a different spell in

the archive. The new spell must be of the divina

tion school.

When a creature you can see within 30 feet of

you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a

saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend

1 charge and force the creature to roll a d4 and ap

ply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your

choice) to the original roll. You can do this after

you see the roll but before its effects are applied.

CHAPTER 5  ]  MAGICAL MISCELLANY

ATLAS OF

ENOEss lloRizoNs

ATLAS OF ENDLESS HORIZONS

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a

wizard)

This thick book is bound in dark leather, criss

crossed with inlaid silver lines suggesting a map or

chart. When found, the book contains the following

spells, which are wizard spells for you while you are

attuned to the book: arcane gate, dimension door,

gate, misty step, plane shift,  teleportation circle, and

word of recall. It functions as a spell book for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as

a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains ld3 ex

pended charges daily at dawn. You can use the

charges in the following ways while holding it:

If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can

expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared

wizard spells with a different spell in the book.

The new spell must be of the conjuration school.

When you are hit by an attack, you can use your

reaction to expend 1  charge to teleport up to

10 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. If

your new position is out of range of the attack, it

misses you.

BABA YAGA'S MORTAR AND PESTLE

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

The creations of the immortal hag Baba Yaga defy

the laws of mortal magic. Among the notorious

implements that cement her legend on countless

worlds are the artifacts that propel her through

the planes: Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle. These

signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact

for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects

become separated, the pestle appears next to the

mortar at the next dawn.

Random Properties. This artifact has the follow

ing random properties, which you can determine by

rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the

Dungeon Master's Guide:

2 minor beneficial properties

1 major beneficial property

1 minor detrimental property

Properties of the Mortar. The mortar is a Tiny

wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in

size to accommodate anything you place inside, ex

panding---if there's enough space-up to Large size,

meaning it can hold even a Large creature.

Properties of the Pestle. The pestle is a 6-inch

long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn

while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it

into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no

action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a

magic weapon that grants a + 3 bonus to attack and

damage rolls made with it.

The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a

melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to

3 of its charges to deal an extra ld8 force damage

for each charge expended. The pestle regains all ex

pended charges daily at dawn.

Perfect Tools. While holding the mortar and pes

tle, you can use your action to say the name of any

nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount

of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar in

stantly fills with the desired amount of that material.

Once you use this action, you can't do so again until

you finish a short or long rest.

You can also use the artifact as alchemist's sup

plies, brewer's supplies, cook's utensils, an herb

alism kit, and a poisoner's it. You have advantage

on any check you make using the artifact as one of

these tools.

Primal Parts. As an action while the pestle and

the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command

the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you

use your action to verbally command it to stop, the

pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of

the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally

useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each

of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes 4dl0

force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points

to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste,

as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If

you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the

mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone,

crushed herbs, pulped organs-into separate piles.

Traverse the Night. If you are holding the pestle

while you are inside the mortar, you can use your

action to verbally command the mortar to travel

to a specific place or creature. You don't need to

know where your destination is, but it must be a

specific destination-not just the nearest river or a

red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within

1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and

vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel

through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the

world passing by below.  Creatures might see images

of you streaking through the sky between your point

of origin and the destination. You arrive at the loca

tion 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later.

Bones Know Their Home. When you command

the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the

dust or paste of something ground by the mortar

and name a location on a different plane of exis

tence or a different world on the Material Plane.

If that material came from a creature native to the

named plane or world, the mortar travels through

an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that

destination, arriving in 1 minute.

CHAPTER 3 ]  MAGICAL MISCELLANY

Destroying the Mortar and Pestle. The mortar

and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed under

foot by the Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga or by Baba

Yaga herself.

BARRIER TATTOO

Wondrous item (tattoo), rarity varies (requires

attunement)

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo

depicts protective imagery and uses ink that resem

bles liquid metal.

Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you

hold the needle to your skin where you want the tat

too to appear, pressing the needle there throughout

the attunement process. When the attunement is

complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes

the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo

vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

Protection. While you aren't wearing armor, the

tattoo grants you an Armor Class depending on the

tattoo's rarity, as shown below. You can use a shield

and still gain this benefit.

BELL BRANCH

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a

druid or warlock)

This silver implement is shaped like a tree branch

and is strung with small golden bells. The branch is

a spellcasting focus for your spells while you hold it.

The branch has 3 charges, and it regains ld3

expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the

charges in the following ways while holding it:

As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to

detect the presence of aberrations, celestials,

constructs, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead

within 60 feet of you. If such creatures are pres

ent and don't have total cover from you, the bells

ring softly,  their tone indicating the creature

types present.

As an action, you can expend 1 charge to cast pro-

tection from evil and good.

BLOOD FURY TATTOO

Wondrous item (tattoo), legendary (requires

attunement)

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo

evokes fury in its form and colors.

Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you

hold the needle to your skin where you want the tat

too to appear, pressing the needle there throughout

the attunement process. When the attunement is

complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes

the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo

vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

Bloodthirsty Strikes. The tattoo has 10 charges,

and it regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

While this tattoo is on your skin, you gain the follow

ing benefits:

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you

can expend a charge to deal an extra 4d6 necrotic

damage to the target, and you regain a number of

hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.

When a creature you can see damages you, you

can expend a charge and use your reaction to

make a melee attack against that creature, with

advantage on your attack roll.

BLOODWELL VIAL

Wondrous item, uncommon (+1), rare (+2), very rare

(+3) (requires attunement by a sorcerer)

To attune to this vial, you must place a few drops

of your blood into it. The vial can't be opened while

your attunement to it lasts. If your attunement to the

vial ends, the contained blood turns to ash. You can

use the vial as a spellcasting focus for your spells

while wearing or holding it, and you gain a bonus

to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of

your sorcerer spells. The bonus is determined by

the vial's rarity.

In addition, when you roll any Hit Dice to recover

hit points while you are carrying the vial, you can re

gain 5 sorcery points. This property of the vial can't

be used again until the next dawn.

CAULDRON OF REBIRTH

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a

druid or warlock)

This Tiny pot bears relief scenes of heroes on its

cast iron sides. You can use the cauldron as a spe]]

casting focus for your druid spells, and it functions

as a suitable component for the scrying spell. When

you finish a long rest, you can use the cauldron to

create a potion of greater healing. The potion lasts

for 24 hours, then loses its magic if not consumed.

As an action, you can cause the cauldron to grow

large enough for a Medium creature to crouch

within. You can revert the cauldron to its normal

size as an action, harmlessly shunting anything that

can't fit inside to the nearest unoccupied space.

If you place the corpse of a humanoid into the

it (no action required), if the creature is ever more

than 15 feet away from you, or if you use this tattoo

on a different creature.

CROOK OF RAO

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to

shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the

Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals devel

oped their own methods of dealing with existential

threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In

recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was redis

covered and leveraged against the rising power of

the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the

wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv

managed to damage the crook during the battle, in

fecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential

for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was

again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed

artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the arti

fact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using

the Crook of Rao-potentially for the final time.

Random Properties. The artifact has the follow

ing random properties, which you can determine by

rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the

Dungeon Master's Guide:

is consumed and the creature returns to life as if by

raise dead at the next dawn. Once used, this prop

erty can't be used again for 7 days.

COILING GRASP TATTOO

Wondrous item (tattoo),  uncommon (requires

attunement)

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo has

long intertwining designs.

Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you

hold the needle to your skin where you want the tat

too to appear, pressing the needle there throughout

the attunement process. When the attunement is

complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes

the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo

vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

Grasping Tendrils. While the tattoo is on your

skin, you can, as an action, cause the tattoo to ex

trude into inky tendrils, which reach for a creature

you can see within 15 feet of you. The creature must

succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or take

3d6 force damage and be grappled by you. As an

action, the creature can escape the grapple by suc

ceeding on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity

Destroying or Repairing the Crook. The Crook

of Rao can either be destroyed or repaired by jour

neying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from

the eternally serene god Rao. One way to make the

emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with

the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revela

tions beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook

dissolves if immersed in the god's tear for a year

and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the

Crook loses its Failing Matrix property.

CRYSTALLINE CHRONICLE

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a

wizard)

An etched crystal sphere the size of a grapefruit

hums faintly and pulses with irregular flares of

inner light. While you are touching the crystal,

you can retrieve and store information and spells

within the crystal at the same rate as reading and

writing. When found, the crystal contains the fol

lowing spells: detect thoughts, intellect fortress,

Rary's telepathic bond, sending, telekinesis, Tasha's

mind whip, and Tenser's floating disk (spells with

an asterisk appear in this book). It functions as a

CRYSTALLINE

CHRONICLE

Spells. The crook has 6 charges. While holding

it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its

charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC

18) from it: aura of life (2 charges), aura of purity (2

charges), banishment (1 charge), beacon of hope (1

charge), mass cure wounds (3 charges). The crook

regains ld6 expended charges daily at dawn.

Absolute Banishment. While you are attuned to

the crook and holding it, you can spend 10 minutes

to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1 mile

of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or

higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent

back to its home plane and can't return to the plane

the Crook of Rao banished it from for 100 years.

Failing Matrix. Whenever the Crook of Rao's Ab

solute Banishment property is used, or when its last

charge is expended, roll on the Extraplanar Rever

sal table. Any creatures conjured as a result of this

effect appear in random unoccupied spaces within

60 feet of you and are not under your control.

property).

Iggwilv's Curse. When the Crook was last used

against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the

artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years,

this curse has spread within the crook, threatening

to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs,

the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is de

stroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding

into a SO-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions

as a permanent gate spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate

then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly

speaks a fiend's name in lggwilv's voice, doing SO

until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by

the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn

through the gate. This process takes eighteen years

to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes

a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of

the Abyss.

CHAPTER 5  ]  MAGICAL MISCELLANY

spellbook for you, with its spells and other writing

psychically encoded within it.

While you are holding the crystal, you can use it

as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells, and

you know the mage hand, mind sliver (appears in

this book), and message cantrips if you don't already

know them.

The crystal has 3 charges, and it regains ld3

expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the

charges in the following ways while holding it:

If you spend 1 minute studying the information

within the crystal, you can expend 1 charge to

replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a

different spell in the book.

When you cast a wizard spell, you can expend 1

charge to cast the spell without verbal, somatic, or

material components of up to 100 gp value.

DEMONOMICON OF IGGWILV

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

An expansive treatise documenting the Abyss's in

finite layers and inhabitants, the Demonomicon of

lggwilv is the most thorough and blasphemous tome

of demonology in the multiverse. The tome recounts

both the oldest and most current profanities of the

Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to cen

sor the text, and while sections have been ripped

from the book's spine, the general chapters remain,

ever revealing demonic secrets. And the book holds

more than blasphemies. Caged behind lines of

script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which

keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many

pages are removed, and it longs to be more than

mere reference material.

Random Properties. The artifact has the follow

random properties, which you can determine by

rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the

Dungeon Master's Guide:

2 minor beneficial properties

1 minor detrimental property

1 major detrimental property

Spells. The book has 8 charges. It regains ld8

expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it,

you can use an action to cast Tasha's hideous laugh

tr fron it or to expend 1 or more of its charges to

cast one of the following spells (save DC 20) from it:

magic circle (1 charge), magic jar (3 charges), planar

ally (3 charges), planar binding (2 charges), plane

shift (to layers of the Abyss only; 3 charges), sum

mon fiend (3 charges; appears in this book).

Abyssal Reference. You can reference the Demo

nomicon whenever you make an Intelligence check

to discern information about demons or a Wisdom

(Survival) check related to the Abyss. When you do

so, you can add double your proficiency bonus to

the check.

DEMONOMICON

OF IGGwILv

Fiendish Scourging. Your magic causes pain to

fiends. While carrying the book, when you make a

damage roll for a spell you cast against a fiend, you

use the maximum possible result instead of rolling.

Ensnarement. While carrying the book, when

ever you cast the magic circle spell naming only

fiends, or the planar binding spell targeting a fiend,

the spell is cast at 9th level, regardless of what level

spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the fiend has

disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell.

Containment. The first 10 pages of the Demon

omicon are blank. As an action while holding the

book, you can target a fiend that you can see that

is trapped within a magic circle. The fiend must

succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw with

disadvantage or become trapped within one of the

Dernonornicon's empty blank pages, which fills

with writing detailing the trapped creature's widely

known name and depravities. Once used, this action

can't be used again until the next dawn.

When you finish a long rest, if you and the Demo

nomicon are on the same plane of existence, the

trapped creature of the highest challenge rating

within the book can attempt to possess you. You

must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a

failure, you are possessed by the creature, which

controls you like a puppet. The possessing crea

ture can release you as an action, appearing in the

CHAPTER 3  /  MAGICAL MISCELLANY

closest unoccupied space. On a successful save, the

fiend can't try to possess you again for 7 days.

When the tome is discovered, it has ld4 fiends

occupying its pages, typically an assortment

of demons.

Destroying the Demonomicon. To destroy the

book, six different demon lords must each tear out

a sixth of the book's pages. If this occurs, the pages

reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours

pass, anyone who opens the book's remaining bind

ing is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss

that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this

deadly, semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost artifact,

Fraz-Urb'luu's Staff. If the staff is dragged from the

pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and

quite out-of-date copy of the Tome of Zyx, the work

that served as the foundation for the Demonomi

con. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz

Urb'luu instantly knows.

DEVOTEE'S CENSER

Weapon (flail), rare (requires attunement by a cleric

or paladin)

The rounded head of this flail is perforated with tiny

holes, arranged in symbols and patterns. The flail

counts as a holy symbol for you. When you hit with

an attack using this magic flail, the target takes an

extra ld8 radiant damage.

DEVOTEE'S CENSER

As a bonus action, you can speak the command

word to cause the flail to emanate a thin cloud of in

cense out to 10 feet for 1 minute. At the start of each

of your turns, you and any other creatures in the in

cense each regain ld4 hit points. This property can't

be used again until the next dawn.

DUPLICITOUS MANUSCRIPT

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a

wizard)

spells: hallucinatory terrain, major image, mirror im

age, mislead, Nystul's magic aura, phantasmal force,

The book has 3 charges, and it regains ld3 ex

pended charges daily at dawn. You can use the

charges in the following ways while holding it:

If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can

expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared

wizard spells with a different spell in the book.

The new spell must be of the illusion school.

When a creature you can see makes an Intelli

gence (Investigation) check to discern the true

nature of an illusion spell you cast, or makes a

saving throw against an illusion spell you cast, you

can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to im

pose disadvantage on the roll.

to nonmagical attacks, and you gain a +l bonus to

attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes.

126

CHAPTER3 ]  MAGICAL MISCELLANY

Eldritch Maul. As a bonus action, you can em

power the tattoo for 1 minute. For the duration, each

damage on a hit. Once used, this bonus action can't

be used again until the next dawn.

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a

focus while you hold or wear it.

cause a slimy tentacle to rip through the fabric of

reality and strike one creature you can see within

30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Cha

risma saving throw against your spell save DC or

take 3d6 psychic damage and become frightened of

you until the start of your next turn.

FEY WILD SHARD

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by

a sorcerer)

This warm crystal glints with the sunset colors of

the Feywild sky and evokes whispers of emotional

memory. As an action, you can attach the shard to a

Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry)

or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends.

You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while

you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell

while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can

roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in the Player's

Handbook. If the result is a spell, it is too wild to

be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally

requires concentration, it doesn't require concentra

tion in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.

If you don't have the Wild Magic Sorcerous Ori

gin, once this property is used to roll on the Wild

Magic Surge table, it can't be used again until the

next dawn.

souls so wicked mortals dare not free them upon an

unsuspecting afterlife.

Created by a figure ofVistani legend, Luba's

Tarokka of Souls shaped the destiny of countless

heroes. The prophecies of this deck of cards also

revealed great evils and guided its creator into the

path of nefarious forces. Untold times the deck's

crcator,  Mother Luba, narrowly cscapcd door1,

spared only by her keen insights. But even for her

not all wickedness could be escaped. In the most

dire cases, Mother Luba managed to ensnare beings

of pure evil amid the strands of fate, imprisoning

them within her tarroka deck. There these foul spir

its dwell still, trapped within a nether-realm hidden

amid shuffling cards, waiting for fate to turn foul

as it inevitably will.

Until the released soul is destroyed, it gains the ben

and both you and the original target of Twist of Fate

suffer the effect of woe.

Shuffling Fate. If you go 7 days without using the

Twist of Fate property, your attunement to Luba's

CHAPTER 5 ]  MAGICAL MISCELLANY

M OTHER  LUBA AND THE VISTANI

The creator of the Tarokka of Souls, Mother Luba was

one of the most influential leaders of the Vistani. For

untold generations, the Vistani  have wandered the

Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like

the vampire-haunted realm of Barovia. These travelers

have learned many secrets of these domains and en

countered countless others wandering amid the Shad

owfell's horrors. Most Vistani bands accept well-inten

tioned wayfarers from diverse walks and of disparate

origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid

the endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists.

A halfling Vistani, Mother Luba led one of the largest

Fluid Ink. As a bonus action, you can shape the

tattoo into any color or pattern and move it to any

area of your skin. Whatever form it takes, it is al

ways obviously a tattoo. It can range in size from no

smaller than a copper piece to an intricate work of

art that covers all your skin.

Disguise Self. As an action, you can use the tat

too to cast the disguise self spell (DC 13 to discern

the disguise). Once the spell is cast from the tat

too, it can't be cast from the tattoo again until the

next dawn.

groups of Vistani in the ShadowfeH. She hailed from

the same world that Count Strahd von Zarovich and

Madam Eva came from, and she created a community.

of kindness and resilience--ever rare to find in the

Plane of Shadow. She led her people in welcoming

strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel.

She and Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam

Eva began bargaining with the creatures of the night.

"We may wander amid the shadows," Mother Luba

said. "But we must ever serve as a light to our fellow

travelers."

Some years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the

mists, leaving behind only the Tarokka of Souls. It is

said that if you draw the Mists card from it, you can

hear the whispers of her kind voice.

LYRE OF BUILDING

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a

bard)

While holding this lyre, you can cast mending as an

action. You can also play the lyre as a reaction when

an object or a structure you can see within 300 feet

of you takes damage, causing it to be immune to

that damage and any further damage of the same

type until the start of your next turn.

In addition, you can play the lyre as an action to

cast fabricate, move earth, passwall, or summon

construct (appears in this book), and that spell can't

be cast from it again until the next dawn.

MASQUERADE TATTOO

Wondrous item (tattoo), common (requires

attunement)

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo ap

pears on your body as whatever you desire.

Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you

hold the needle to your skin where you want the tat

too to appear, pressing the needle there throughout

the attunement process. When the attunement is

the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo

vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

MIGHTY SERVANT OF LEUK-O

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

Named for the warlord who infamously employed

it, the Mighty Servant of Leuk-o is a fantastically

powerful, 10-foot-tall machine that turns into an an

imate construct when piloted. Crafted of a gleaming

black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often

described as a combination of a disproportioned

dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains

enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compart

ment within, from which up to two Medium crea

tures can control it-and potentially execute a spree

of unstoppable destruction.

Tales of the servant's origins involve more con

jecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly be

ings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the

supposedly related device known as the Machine

of Lum the Mad. The best details on the device's

origins and operation can be found in the Mind of

Metal, a tome of artificer's secrets that connects the

device to the traditions of the lost Olman people,

and which was written by Lum the Mad's several

times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while

she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty

Servant of Leuk-o.

Dangerous Attunement. Two creatures can be

attuned to the servant at a time. If a third creature

tries to attune to it, nothing happens.

The servant's controls are accessed by a hatch in

its upper back, which is easily opened while there

are no creatures attuned to the artifact.

Attuning to the artifact requires two hours, which

can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during

which tirne you must be inside the servant, interact

ing with its controls. While crew members are at

tuning themselves, any creature or structure outside

and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 percent

chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its

Destructive Fist attacks once during the attune

ment. This process must be undergone every time a

creature attunes itself to the artifact.

CHAPTER 3  ]  MAGICAL MISCELLANY

While there are no attuned creatures inside the

servant, it is an inert object.

Ghost in the Machine. Upon his death, the soul

of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the

artifact and has become its animating force. The

servant has been known to attack or move of its own

accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruc

tion. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM's

discretion, takes one action while uncrewed.

If the servant loses half of its hit points or more,

each creature attuned to it must succeed on a DC 20

existence.

Magic Resistant Construction. The servant has advantage on

saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and

spell attacks made against it have disadvantage.

Regeneration. The servant regains 10 hit points at the start of

its turn. If it is reduced to O hit points, this trait doesn't func

high jump is up to 25 feet, with or without a running start.

ACTIONS

Destructive Fist. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +17 to hit,

reach 10 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (4d12 + 10)

force damage. If the target is an object, it takes triple damage.

Crushing Leap. If the servant jumps at least 25 feet as part of

its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a

space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those

creatures is pushed to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the

servant and must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a

failed save, a creature takes 26 (4d12) bludgeoning damage and

is knocked prone. On a successful  save, a creature takes half as

much damage and isn't knocked prone.

M1GITy SERVANT OF LEUK-O

Controlling the Servant. While any creatures are

attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open

the hatch as easily as any other door. Other crea

tures can open the hatch as an action with a suc

cessful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.

A knock spell cast on the hatch also opens it until

the start of the caster's next turn.

A creature can enter or exit through the hatch by

spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the ser

vant have total cover from effects originating outside

it. The controls within it allow creatures to see out

side without obstruction.

While you are inside the servant, you can com

mand it by using the controls. During your turn (for

either attuned creature), you can command it in the

following ways:

Open or close the hatch (no action required,

once per turn)

Move the servant up to its speed (no ac

tion required)

As an action, you can command the servant to

take one of the actions in its stat block or some

other action.

When a creature provokes an opportunity attack

from the servant, you can use your reaction to

command the servant to make one Destructive

Fist attack against that creature.

CHAPTER 3  ]  MAGICAL MISCELLANY

Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 24 hours.

While charmed in this way,  the creature goes on a

destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and

attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the

servant, starting with those threatening the arti

fact-preferably using the servant, if possible.

Self-Destruct. By inputting a specific series of

lever pulls and button presses, the servant's two

crew members can cause it to explode. The self-de

struct code is not revealed to crew members when

they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered

(the DM determines how), it requires two attuned

crew members to be inside the servant and spend

their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing

the command. Should the crew members begin the

process of entering the code, though, the servant

uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns

the crew members against each other.

If the crew members successfully implement the

code, at the end of the third round, the servant ex

plodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere

centered on the servant must make a DC 25 Dex

terity saving throw.  On a failed save, a creature

takes 87 (25d6) force damage, 87 (25d6) lightning

damage, and 87 (25d6) thunder damage. On a suc

cessful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

Objects and structures in the area take triple dam

age. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly

and leave behind no remains.

This does not destroy the servant permanently.

Rather, 2d6 days later, its parts-left arm, left leg,

right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso

drop from the sky in random places within 1,000

miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet

of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform

the servant.

Destroying the Servant. The servant can be

destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed,

its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one

of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators.

Alternatively, if the servant strikes the Machine of

Lum the Mad, both artifacts explode in an eruption

that is three times the size and three times the dam

age as the servant's self-destruct property.

MOON SICKLE

SHADOWFELL BRAND TATTOO

Wondrous item (tattoo), rare (requires attunement)

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo is

dark in color and abstract.

Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you

hold the needle to your skin where you want the tat

too to appear, pressing the needle there throughout

the attunement process. When the attunement is

complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes

the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo

vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

Shadow Essence. You gain darkvision with a

range of 60 feet, and you have advantage on Dexter

weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off

if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard

as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell

while you are holding or wearing the shard, you

can momentarily curse one creature targeted by

the spell; choose one ability score, and until the

end of your next turn, the creature has disadvan

tage on ability checks and saving throws that use

that ability.

SPELLWROUGHT TATTOO

Wondrous item (tattoo), rarity varies

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo

contains a single spell of up to 5th level, wrought

ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the

skin in whatever design you like. Once the tattoo is

there, you can cast its spell, requiring no material

components. The tattoo glows faintly while you cast

the spell and for the spell's duration. Once the spell

ends, the tattoo vanishes from your skin.

The level of the spell in the tattoo determines the

spell's saving throw DC, attack bonus, spellcasting

ability modifier, and the tattoo's rarity, as shown in

the Spellwrought Tattoo table.

A TOOTH oF

DA+LVER-NAR

TEETH OF DAHLVER-NAR

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

The Teeth of Dahlver-Nar are stories given form.

They are a collection of teeth, each suggestive of

wildly different origins and made from various ma

terials. The collection rests within a leather pouch,

stitched with images of heroes and whimsical crea

tures. Where the teeth fall, they bring legends to life.

Using the Teeth. While you are holding the

pouch, you can use an action to draw one tooth.

Roll on the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar table to deter

mine which tooth you draw, and you can either

sow the tooth or implant it (both of which are de

scribed later).

If you don't sow or implant the tooth, roll a die at

the end of your turn. On an even number, the tooth

vanishes, and creatures appear as if you sowed the

tooth, but they are hostile to you and your allies. On

an odd number, the tooth replaces one of your teeth

as if you implanted it (potentially replacing another

implanted tooth, see below).

Each tooth can only be used once. Track which

teeth have been used. If a tooth's result is rolled af

ter it's been used, you draw the next lowest unused

tooth on the table.

CHAPTER 3  I  MAGICAL MISCELLANY

135

Sowing Teeth. To sow the tooth, you place it on

the ground in an unoccupied space within your

reach, or you throw it into an unoccupied space

within 10 feet of you in a body of water that is at

least 50 feet wide and 50 feet long. Upon doing so,

the tooth burrows into the ground and vanishes,

leaving no hole behind, or it vanishes into the water.

The creatures noted in the Creatures Summoned

column appear in an unoccupied space as close to

where the tooth was sown as possible. The crea

tures are allies to you, speak all languages you

speak, and linger for 10 minutes before disappear

ing, unless otherwise noted.

Implanting Teeth. To implant the tooth, you place

it in your mouth, whereupon one of your own teeth

falls out, and the drawn tooth takes its place, resiz

ing to fit in your mouth. Once the tooth is implanted,

you gain the effect noted in the Implanted Effect col

umn. The tooth can't be removed while you are at

tuned to the teeth, and you can't voluntarily end your

attunement to them. If removed after your death, the

tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number

of the teeth implanted at one time equal to 1 + your

Constitution modifier (minimum of 2 teeth total). If

you try to implant more teeth, the newly implanted

tooth replaces one of the previous teeth, determined

randomly. The replaced tooth vanishes, and you lose

the implanted effect.

Recovering Teeth. Once all the teeth have van

ished, their pouch also vanishes. The pouch with

all the teeth then appears in a random destination,

which could be on a different world of the Mate

rial Plane.

Destroying the Teeth. Each tooth must be de

stroyed individually by sowing it in the area where

the tooth's story originated, with the intention to

destroy it. When planted in this way, creatures sum

moned are not friendly to you and do not vanish.

Some of the creatures summoned merely head off in

search of home, while others act as their tales dic

tate. In either case, the tooth is gone forever.

diseases and poisons affecting it are removed. When you use this

action, a shimmering image of a unicorn's horn appears until the

end of your turn, sprouting from your forehead. The tooth regains

all expended charges daily at dawn. You gain the following flaw:

"When I  see wickedness in action, I  must oppose it."

You gain telepathy out to 120 feet as described in the Monster Man

!  TA6HA

Before making characters or playing the game, the

DM and players can run a special session-colloqui

ally called session zero-to establish expectations,

outline the terms of a social contract, and share

house rules. Making and sticking to these rules can

help ensure that the game is a fun experience for

everyone involved.

Often a session zero includes building characters

together. As the DM, you can help players during

the character creation process by advising them to

select options that will serve the adventure or cam

paign that awaits.

CHARACTER AND PARTY CREATION

Each player has options when it comes to choosing

a character race, class, and background, though you

may restrict certain options that are deemed unsuit

able for the campaign. If there are multiple players

in the group, you should encourage them to choose

different classes so that the adventuring party has

a range of abilities. It's less important that the party

include multiple backgrounds, as sometimes it's

fun to play an all-soldier party or a troupe of adven

turing entertainers. The backgrounds they choose

define who their characters were before becoming

s 2

adventurers and also include roleplaying hooks in

the form of ideals, bonds, and flaws-things you

ought to know. For example, if a player chooses

the criminal background, one of the options for the

character's bond is, "I'm trying to pay off an old debt

I owe to a generous benefactor." If that's the charac

ter's bond, you should work with the player to decide

who that generous benefactor is and build relevant

storylines into the larger campaign.

PARTY FORMATION

During session zero, your role is to let the players

build the characters they want and to help them

come up with explanations for how their charac

ters came together to form an adventuring party. It

can be helpful to assume that the characters know

each other and have some sort of history together,

however brief that history might be. Here are some

questions you can ask the players as they create

characters to get a sense of the party's relationships:

Are any of the characters related to each other?

What keeps the characters together as a party?

What does each character like most about every

other member of the adventuring party?

Does the group have a patron? See chapter 2,

"Group Patrons," for patron examples.

If the players are having trouble coming up with a

story for how their characters met, they may choose

an option from the Party Origin table or let a d6 roll

choose it for them. You should spend part of session

zero helping the players flesh out the details. For ex

ample, if the characters came together to overcome

a common foe, the identity of this enemy needs to

be determined. If a funeral gathered the group, the

identity of the deceased and each character's rela

tionship to them will need to be fleshed out.

CHAPTER 4 ]  DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS

j39

R U N N IN G A GAM E  FOR ONE PLAYER

ADM running a game for one player should spend

part of session zero working with that player to

come up with their character's backstory, then

let the player decide if they want the character to

have a sidekick (see the "Sidekicks" section in

this chapter).

You might need to help the player run the sidekick

for the first few sessions and should make sure the

player understands the functions and limitations of

sidekicks:

Sidekicks are stalwart companions who can per

form tasks both in and out of combat, including

things such as setting up camp and carrying gear.

Ideally, a sidekick's abilities should comple

ment those of the main character. For exam

ple, a spellcaster makes a good sidekick for a

fighter or rogue.

CHAPTER 4 ]  DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS

SOCIAL CONTRACT

D&D is first and foremost meant to be a fun-for-all

experience. If one or more participants aren't hav

ing fun, the game won't last long. Session zero is

the perfect time for you and the players to discuss

the experience they're hoping for, as well as topics,

themes, and behavior they deem inappropriate. Out

of this discussion, a social contract begins to form.

Sometimes a social contract takes shape organi

cally, but it's good practice to have a direct conver

sation during session zero to establish boundaries

and expectations. A typical social contract in a D&D

group includes implicit or explicit commitments to

the following points:

You will respect the players by running a game

that is fun, fair, and tailored for them. You will al

low every player to contribute to the ongoing story

and give every character moments to shine. When

a player is talking, you are listening.

The players will respect you and the effort it takes

to create a fun game for everyone. The players will

allow you to direct the campaign, arbitrate the

rules, and settle arguments. When you are talking,

the players are listening.

 g

z

<t

:;

2

The players will respect one another,  listen to one

another, support one another, and do their utmost

to preserve the cohesion of the adventuring party.

Should you or a player disrespect each other or

violate the social contract in some other way,  the

group may dismiss that person from the table.

This social contract covers the basics, but indi-

vidual groups might require additional agreed-upon

terms to guarantee a fun play experience for all. And

a social contract typically evolves as a group's mem

bers learn more about one another.

HARD AND SOFT LIMITS

Once you and the players have acknowledged the

terms of the game's social contract and agreed to

uphold them, the conversation can segue into a dis

cussion about soft and hard limits. There are many

ways to mediate this discussion, and you might want

to do some research to find an approach that might

work well for your group. For purposes of this expla

nation, these terms are described as follows:

A soft limit is a threshold that one should think

twice about crossing, as it is likely to create genu

ine anxiety, fear, and discomfort.

A hard limit is a threshold that should never

be crossed.

Every member of the group has soft and hard lim

its, and it behooves everyone in the group to know

what they are. Make sure everyone at the table is

comfortable with how this discussion takes place.

Players might not want to discuss their limits aloud

around the table, especially if they're new to role

playing games or haven't spent a lot of time with

certain other members of the group. One way to

alleviate such discomfort is to encourage the players

to share their limits privately with you and allow

you to present them without attribution to the whole

group. For example, the players could write their

limits on index cards for you to read aloud. However

these limits are presented, it would be useful for you

or one of the players to compile the limits into one

list that can be shared with the whole group. Keep

in mind that any discussion about limits should be

treated with care-even sharing a person's limits

can be a very painful experience, and this conversa

tion should be handled with respect.

Common in-game limits include-but are not lim

ited to-themes or scenes of sex, exploitation, racial

profiling, slavery, violence toward children and ani

mals, gratuitous swearing, and intra-party romance.

Common out-of-game limits include unwanted phys

ical contact, dice-sharing, dice-throwing, shouting,

vulgarity, rules lawyering, distracting use of cell

phones, and generally disrespectful behavior.

The discussion of limits is important because

DMs and players can have phobias or triggers that

others might not be aware of. Any in-game topic or

theme that makes a member of the gaming group

feel unsafe or uncomfortable should be avoided. If a

topic or theme makes one or more players nervous

but they give you consent to include it in-game, in

corporating it should be handled with care, and you

must be ready to veer away from such topics and

themes quickly.

While session zero is the perfect place to start this

discussion, it might not be the only time limits are

addressed. Someone might cross a line and need to

be reminded of a limit, or someone might not think

to include some of their limits in the initial discus

sion. Players can also discover new limits as the

campaign unfolds. Make a plan to check in with the

group to make sure the list of hard and soft limits

is up to date, and remind everyone to revisit this list

often in case it changes.

GAME  CUSTOMIZATION

In addition to shaping the game around the char

acters in the adventuring party, you should be

prepared to customize the game to suit the players'

tastes. The "Know Your Players" section in the in

troduction of the Dungeon Master's Guide provides

some guidance for doing so, based on known player

archetypes. To help identity what types of players

are in the group, you can ask each player any or all

of the following questions:

Which of the three pillars of adventuring (combat,

exploration, roleplaying) interest you the most?

How much humor do you like in the game?

What level of technology do you prefer?

Do you enjoy solving in-game puzzles and riddles?

Do you like to track experience points, or would

you rather have your character advance in level

when I tell you to?

HOUSE RULES

House rules include optional rules, such as those

presented in chapter 9 of the Dungeon Master's

Guide, and rules you create. If you plan to use any

house rules, session zero is a good time to discuss

those rules with the players and solicit their input.

House rules are best presented as experiments,

and time will tell if they're good for your game. If

you introduce a house rule in session zero that

turns out to have an adverse effect on people's en

joyment of the game, you may jettison or revise the

house rule to create a better gaming experience for

everyone. Don't feel bad if a house rule doesn't end

up working as well as you expected it to. Remember:

the goal is to ensure everyone is having fun.

SIDEKICKS

,

TASHA

!

weewefloe me ww@ fsee

This section provides a straightforward way to add

a special NPC-called a sidekick-to the group of

adventurers. These rules take a creature with a low

challenge rating and give it levels in one of three

simple classes: Expert, Spellcaster, or Warrior.

A sidekick can be incorporated into a group at

the party's inception, or a sidekick might join them

during the campaign. For example, the characters

might meet a villager, an animal, or another crea

ture, forge a friendship, and invite the creature to

join them on their adventures.

You can also use these rules to customize a mon

ster for your own use as DM.

CREATING A SIDEKICK

A sidekick can be any type of creature with a stat

block in the Monster Manual or another D&D book,

but the challenge rating in its stat block must be 1/2

or lower. You take that stat block and add to it, as ex

plained in the "Gaining a Sidekick Class" section.

To join the adventurers, the sidekick must be the

friend of at least one of them. This friendship might

be connected to a character's backstory or to events

that have transpired in play. For example, a sidekick

could be a childhood friend or pet, or it might be a

creature the adventurers saved. As DM, you deter

mine whether there is sufficient trust established for

the creature to join the group.

You decide who plays the sidekick. Here are

some options:

A player plays the sidekick as their second charac

ter-ideal when you have only one or two players.

A player plays the sidekick as their only char

acter-ideal for a player who wants a character

who's simpler than a typical player character.

The players jointly play the sidekick.

You play the sidekick.

There's no limit on the number of sidekicks in a

group, but having more than one per player charac

ter can noticeably slow down the game. And when

estimating the difficulty of an upcoming encounter,

count each sidekick as a character.

GAINING A SIDEKICK CLASS

When you create a sidekick, you choose the class

it will have for the rest of its career: Expert, Spell

caster, or Warrior, each of which is detailed below.

If a sidekick class contains a choice, you may make

the choice or let the players make it.

STARTING LEVEL

The starting level of a sidekick is the same as the

average level of the group. For example, if a lst-level

group starts out with a sidekick, that sidekick is also

1st level, but if a 10th-level group invites a sidekick

to join them, that sidekick starts at 10th level.

LEVELING UP A SIDEKICK

Whenever a group's average level goes up, the side

kick gains a level. It doesn't matter how much of the

group's recent adventures the sidekick experienced;

the sidekick levels up because of a combination

of the adventures it shared with the group and its

own training.

HIT POINTS

Whenever the sidekick gains a level, it gains one Hit

Die, and its hit point maximum increases. To deter

mine the amount of the increase, roll the Hit Die

(the type of die appears in the sidekick's stat block),

and add its Constitution modifier. It gains a mini

mum of 1 hit point per level.

If the sidekick drops to O hit points and isn't killed

outright, it falls unconscious and subsequently

makes death saving throws, just like a player

character.

PROFICIENCY BONUS

The sidekick's proficiency bonus is determined by

its level in its class, as shown in the class's table.

Whenever the sidekick's proficiency bonus in

creases by 1, add 1 to the to-hit modifier of all the

attacks in its stat block, and increase the DCs in its

stat block by 1.

ABILITY SCORE INCREASES

Whenever the sidekick gains the Ability Score Im

provement feature, adjust anything in its stat block

that relies on an ability modifier that you increase.

For example, if the sidekick has an attack that uses

its Strength modifier, increase the attack's mod

ifiers to hit and damage if the Strength modifier

increases.

If it's unclear whether a melee attack in the stat

block uses Strength or Dexterity, the attack can

use either.

EXPERT

The Expert is a master of certain tasks or knowl

edge, favoring cunning over brawn. It might be a

scout, a musician, a librarian, a clever street kid, a

wily merchant, or a burglar.

To gain the Expert class, a creature must have at

least one language in its stat block that it can speak.

A sidekick gains the following class features as it

gains levels, as summarized on the Expert table.

4th-level Expert feature

At 4th level and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and

19th level, the sidekick increases one ability score of

your choice by 2, or the sidekick increases two abil

ity scores of your choice by 1. The sidekick can't in

crease an ability score above 20 using this feature.

COORDINATED STRIKE

6th-level Expert feature

The sidekick is adept at fighting in concert with a

companion. When the sidekick uses its Helpful fea

ture to aid an ally in attacking a creature, that target

can be up to 30 feet away from the sidekick, and the

sidekick can deal an extra 2d6 damage to it the next

time the sidekick hits it with an attack roll before

the end of the current turn. The extra damage is the

same type of damage dealt by the attack.

EVASION

7th-level Expert feature

Because of extraordinary good luck, the sidekick

is skilled at avoiding danger. When the sidekick

is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a

Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it

instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving

throw, and only half damage if it failed. The sidekick

doesn't benefit from this feature while incapacitated.

INSPIRING HELP

11th-level Expert feature

When the sidekick takes the Help action, the crea

ture who receives the help also gains a ld6 bonus to

the d20 roll. If that roll is an attack roll, the creature

can forgo adding the bonus to it, and then if the

attack hits, the creature can add the bonus to the

attack's damage roll against one target.

At 20th level, the bonus increases to 2d6.

RELIABLE TALENT

14th-lcvcl Expert feature

The sidekick has refined its skills to an exceptional

degree. Whenever the sidekick makes an ability

check that includes its whole proficiency bonus, it

can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

SHARP MIND

The sidekick gains proficiency in one of the follow

ing saving throws of your choice: Intelligence, Wis

dom, or Charisma.

CHAPTER 4 ]  DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS

A sidekick who becomes a Spellcaster walks the

paths of magic. The sidekick might be a hedge wiz

ard, a priest, a soothsayer, a magical performer, or a

person with magic in their veins.

To gain the Spellcaster class, a creature must

can speak.

A sidekick gains the following class features as

it gains levels in this class, as summarized on the

Spellcaster table.

BONUS PROFICIENCIES

Ist-level Spellcaster feature

The sidekick gains proficiency with light armor,

and if it is a humanoid or has a simple or martial

weapon in its stat block, it also gains proficiency

with all simple weapons.

SPELLCASTING

1st-level Spellcaster feature

The sidekick gains the ability to cast spells. (If the

creature already has the Spellcasting trait, this fea

ture replaces that trait.) Choose the Spellcaster's

role: Mage, Healer, or Prodigy. This choice deter

mines the spell list and spellcasting ability used by

the sidekick, as shown on the Spellcasting table.

learns more spells of your choice. Each of the spells

in the Spells Known column must be of a level for

which the sidekick has spell slots, as shown on the

table. For instance, when the sidekick reaches 5th

level in this class, it can learn one new spell of 1st or

2nd level.

Additionally,  when the sidekick gains a level in

this class, you can choose one of the spells it knows

from this class and replace it with another spell

from its spell list. The new spell must be a cantrip

or of a level for which the sidekick has spell slots.

Spel/casting Ability. The sidekick's spellcasting

ability for these spells depends on the choice you

made on the Spellcasting table.

The sidekick uses its spellcasting ability whenever

a spell refers to that ability. In addition, it uses its

spellcasting ability modifier when setting the saving

throw DC for a spell it casts and when making an

attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + sidekick's proficiency bonus +

spellcasting ability modifier

Spell attack modifier= sidekick's proficiency bonus+

POTENT CANTRIPS

6th-level Spellcaster feature

The sidekick can add its spellcasting ability modifier

it gains levels in this class, as summarized on the

Warrior table.

BONUS PROFICIENCIES

Ist-level Warrior feature

Meeting a monster doesn't have to spark a fight. An

on any ability check they make to communicate

with a creature if they offer something it wants. The

BLESSED RADIANCE EFFECTS

This section explores how to add fantastical chal

adventure's setting to life.

When a creature's name appears in bold in a table

herein, that indicates that you can find the creature's

stat block in the Monster Manual.

SUPERNATURAL REGIONS

Not all lands thrive as nature intended. Magical

forces, strange interlopers, or tragic events can alter

an area's destiny, fundamentally changing the land.

While the flora, fauna, structures, and inhabitants

might remain unaffected, the land's innate character

takes on new qualities.

A supernatural region is permeated by a preter

natural force in an area as large or small as you

wish. In the affected area, certain effects and brief

encounters reinforce an underlying theme. These

effects occur as characters traverse an influenced

region or add interest to a specific affected location.

The descriptions of the following supernatural

regions summarize the region, present a table of

potential effects within the affected area, and note

The sword deals radiant damage instead of

slashing damage and knows the exact location

of its target while the target is within the re

the region. At the start of the creature's turn,

it must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence saving

tack against the nearest creature it can see. If

there are no other creatures within reach, the

target spends its action babbling.

Bizarre appendages squirm beneath the

ground and around trees or other structures

within this region. Dozens of limbs burst forth,

entangling anyone within a 30-foot sphere

surrounding one random creature. Each crea

ture in the sphere must succeed on a DC 14

Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning

damage and be restrained. Any creature that

ends its turn in the area takes 3d6 bludgeoning

damage. A creature can free itself or someone

else within reach from being restrained in this

way by using an action to make a successful DC

14 Strength or Dexterity check (its choice).

64-72  Creatures in the region can't leave it and find

themselves covering the same ground over and

over.  By the time they realize this, 2d10 hours

FAR REALM

As souls travel away from the Material Plane after

death, they either dwell in the Astral Plane as spir

its or are pulled toward one of the Outer Planes to

continue their journey. But some entities find ways

to travel beyond the Outer Planes to dwell in the

Far Realm. There they transform over eons into

abominations or elder evils, seething in a reality

with its own laws. All who stay in the Far Realm are

eventually twisted into alien shapes by the realm's

eldritch forces.

The Far Realm's pernicious influence is often

subtle, leaking into the Material Plane through thin

places in reality or as invasive thoughts that inspire

life to propagate along alien paths.

Consider rolling on the Far Realm Effects table

when the following circumstances occur in a region

touched by the Far Realm:

A warlock whose Otherworldly Patron is a Great

Old One rolls a 1 or 20 on the d20 for an ability

pacitated. The creature can repeat the saving

throw when it takes damage and at the end

of every hour,  ending the effect on itself on a

success.

10--18  An elder evil turns its attention to the region,

imposing the pressure of its unfathomable

presence upon the place. Any creature that

finishes a rest in the region must succeed on

a DC 12 Charisma saving throw,  or it gains no

benefit from finishing the rest. It instead finds

strange scrawls, stacked stones, or its belong

One random creature in the region hears

strange whispers and must succeed on a DC

While charmed in this way, the creature focuses

on copying the blasphemous designs that ap

pear in its mind using whatever medium it has

available (ink, charcoal, mud, or its own blood).

Unless restrained, the creature completes the

designs in l hour of work. When the creature

finishes its work, it is no longer charmed, and

a death slaad appears within 30 feet of it and

attacks anyone in sight.

80-85  Natural features and structures in this region

writhe to spell out words and form strange

symbols. Any creature that tries to read the

messages must make a DC 20 Intelligence (Ar

insight as if it had cast the contact other plane

spell. On a failure, the creature is affected as

if it failed a saving throw against the confusion

spell. This effect ends at the end of the crea-

tu re's next turn.

86-90

In this region, circular things (such as buttons,

crystal balls, the sun, and so on) seem appall

ingly wrong. One random creature that starts

its turn in this region must succeed on a DC 14

Intelligence saving throw or spend their turn

loudly trying to destroy these objects.

91-95  Glaring eyes, which weep viscid tears, appear

on inanimate objects throughout the region.

These eyes watch the characters, and creatures

within the region can't be surprised by the

characters for as long as the eyes exist. An eye

closes and disappears if it takes any damage.

Realm and connects with a random plane. Any

creature that enters the rift takes lOdl O psychic

HAUNTED

Haunted environs include homes burdened by dark

deeds, the sites of mass killings, and locations

where individuals died while experiencing powerful

fear, sorrow, or hatred. Haunted places bear echoes

of the past and, like ghosts, harass visitors even as

they seek respite from age-old traumas. Few places

are meaninglessly haunted, and you can easily cus

tomize the general results on the following table to

suit all manner of macabre tales.

Consider rolling on the Haunted Effects ta

Multiple creatures are unable to see.

A creature is alone.

Midnight or another ominous hour arrives.

A ghost or other creature tied to the region's grim

candles, do not shed any light.

21-25  The temperature in the region drops by 10

degrees Fahrenheit every hour for the next 1d6

hours, after which the temperature returns to

normal. If cold enough, ice crystals form in sin

ister patterns.

26-30  One random creature's shadow acts inde

acts out of sync with its owner,  perhaps dra

31-35  After the next sunset, the sun doesn't rise

again for 36 hours. During this time, the sky

over the region might hold a crimson moon,

be obscured by roiling fog, or display blinking,

alien stars.

36-40  During the next night, one random sleeping

creature vanishes and reappears approximately

a foot beneath where they were sleeping typ

ically buried in undisturbed dirt or in a space

beneath floorboards. The creature or some

one else can free it with a successful  DC 13

41-45  One random creature in the region is targeted

by the levitate spell  (save DC 15) for l minute.

46-50  A nonviolent but unsettling ghost-perhaps a

pet, an accident-prone child, or a dismembered

big toe-appears and follows one random

creature for 24 hours before vanishing. The

ghost vanishes if reduced to O hit points.

51-55  One player character's appearance changes

for the next 24 hours to reflect the region's

haunted history.  For example, they might mani

notorious tyrant who died in the region.

56-60  For the next 24 hours, any humanoid killed in

the region rapidly decomposes and rises as a

skeleton 1dl0 minutes after dying.

61-65  Over the next 24 hours, whenever any creature

is wounded, its blood (or similar fluid) spreads

to form a short message or grisly tableau.

66-70  A spirit inhabits one character's simple or mar

tial weapon, making it a sentient magic item

until the character leaves the region.  Randomly

generate the item's properties as described in

the "Sentient Magic Items" section of the Dun

71-75  A spectral force manifests to one character in

the region, allowing them to ask one question

and receive a short answer as through the au

gury spell. The force manifests as a planchette

moving on a talking board, writing on foggy

glass, or insects swarming to create messages.

76-80  During the next night, one sleeping character

in the region receives a vision as if the target

of the dream spell. The dream is brief and

unsettling, revealing some element of the envi

INFESTED

On many worlds, the biomass of insects radically

outweighs that of higher organisms. Mass migra

tions and deadly insect species can imperil larger

creatures, but most insects remain nothing more

than an annoyance. However, through wild popu

lation booms, magical manipulation, supernatural

growth, interbreeding with otherworldly species, or

stranger circumstances, insects can overrun an en

tire region. Swarms of insects become the dominant

species in an area, consuming plants and animals,

creating elaborate hives or tunnels, and infesting

structures and the earth.

The following effects represent a region overrun

by insects or hives of similar creatures, likely ma

nipulated by magic, otherworldly intelligence, or

environmental factors to infest an area in countless

numbers and drive out all competing life.

Consider rolling on the Infested Effects ta

Webs, cocoons, hives, anthills, or other insect

contract the sight rot disease (see the Dungeon

tures that move at half their normal walking

speed can ignore the bugs. Those that move

faster must succeed on a DC T6 Constitution

saving throw or become poisoned until the

start of their next turn. A creature poisoned

in this way has its speed reduced to 0, as it is

overcome by the squashed insects' foul smell.

Creatures that don't need to breathe automati

A mirror zone occurs where planar and magical

energies converge and create a place of reflections.

Creatures, objects, and energy reflect, refract, dupli

cate, or are transported elsewhere. Such locations

arise from the intrusion of a theorized Plane of

Mirrors upon the Material Plane, or where powerful

m agic governing transition, protection, or divination

had unexpected results.

Consider rolling on the Mirror Zone Effects

A creature uses any teleportation magic.

An illusion appears.

A creature impersonates another creature.

themselves.

07-12  The hallucinatory terrain spell  (save DC 15) af

fects the natural terrain of the region, changing

it into a different kind of terrain (DM's choice).

13-18  One random creature in the region gains the

benefits of the blink spell for l minute, shim

mering with overlapping shattered reflections.

19-24  Creatures in the region don't cast reflections.

Wisdom (Insight) checks made against those

creatures have disadvantage, and the creatures

have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion)

checks made against anyone who notices their

lack of reflection. When they leave the region,

creatures regain their reflections, and the effect

ends.

25-34

Reflections of ld4 creatures in the region

emerge from mirrors and attack. The reflec

reflections as shadows that are fey instead of

undead and vulnerable to bludgeoning damage

instead ofradiant.

For the next 24 hours, certain wounds caused

in the region attract spectral  slivers of glass

that cause extra damage. Any creature, other

than a construct or an undead, hit by an attack

that deals piercing or slashing damage begins

to bleed, losing ld4 hit points at the start of

each of its turns. If the bleeding creature is hit

by another such attack,  the bleeding increases

by 1d4. Any creature can take an action to

stanch the wound with a successful DC 10 Wis

dom (Medicine) check. The bleeding also stops

if the target receives magical  healing.

allow magical transport while in the region.

Any creature that touches its reflection in an

object that it isn't wearing or carrying can im

DC 17) once within the next 24 hours, requiring

no components but using a mirror or other

reflective surface.

59-64  The skin of one random creature in the region

becomes silvery and reflective for the next 24

hours. For the duration, that creature has ad

vantage on saving throws against spells, and

spell  attacks have disadvantage against that

creature.

65--70  A longsword or shortsword with a blade made

of a jagged mirror appears in an unoccupied

space within 60 feet of a random creature in

the region. The weapon is a sword of wounding

(see the Dungeon Master's Guide). If the weap

on's wielder rolls a 1  or 20 on an attack roll

using the weapon, the weapon shatters and is

destroyed after that attack.

For the next 24 hours, when anyone in the

region  hits  a  creature with  an attack roll  and

deals damage to it, the attacker must succeed

on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or take force

damage equal  to half the damage dealt.

other creatures within 720 feet of it, even crea

tures behind total  cover.

59-64  Creatures in the region suffer from disjointed

thoughts and difficulty concentrating for l

hour.  For the duration, creatures have disad

vantage on Intelligence checks and Constitu

on spells.

65-70  One random creature in the region hears

strange whispers in its mind. The whispers are

fragments of thoughts from other creatures

nearby. The creature has advantage on Wisdom

ponents.  Intelligence is the spellcasting ability

for this spell.

AWAKEN ANYTHING

Legends are filled with natural forces and mundane

objects that take on humanoid characteristics to guide

or confound hemes: statues that sing, animals that

whisper secrets, clouds that speak their mind. While

monsters like elementals, galeb duhr, and treants rep

resent natural forces brought to life, not every chatty

rock or sagacious stream needs a stat block. Perhaps

your adventures take a party to a land where plants

speak freely or a cursed realm where petrified souls

beg for help. Don't feel restricted by the options in the

Monster Manual or by the limitations of the animate

object spell should you want to breathe extra life into

your story. Filling a witch's redoubt with murmuring

relics, a fey forest with eavesdropping vegetation, or

a sky god's temple with avian choirs makes a place

especially memorable. Spells such as animate object,

awaken, speak with animals, speak with plants, and the

like provide guidance on how to bring commonplace

creatures and objects to life.

UNRAVELING MAGIC

The source of magic is damaged or corrupted in this

region. Magic is unpredictable, and strange results

occur when a creature casts a spell. Such regions

come into being when potent rituals go awry (or if

they succeed, in the case of dangerous and destruc

tive undertakings), in the aftermath of cataclysmic

magical battles, or where an artifact was destroyed.

Consider rolling on the Unraveling Magic Effects

table when the following circumstances occur in

the region:

Any charges are expended in a magic item.

teleport.

86-90  One random creature in the region breaks

spells for l  hour. Whenever anyone within 20

feet of the creature casts a spell, the spellcaster

must succeed on a DC 15 saving throw using

its spellcasting ability,  or the spell drains away

without effect. The spell  slot, charge, or feature

use that powered the spell  is wasted.

91-95  During the next 24 hours, the first time a crea

ture in the region targets another creature with

a spell, the caster must make a DC ll saving

throw using its spellcasting ability. On a failed

save, the spell targets the caster instead. On a

successful  save, the spell functions normally.

This effect then ends.

96-00  One random creature in the region can sud

denly cast the wish spell once, within the next

minute. Re roll  if you've rolled this effect in the

past 24 hours.

MAGICAL PHENOMENA

Magic has the ability to make even the most serene

natural settings unpredictable. Whether the result

of magical calamities, otherworldly influences, or

nexuses of inexplicable forces, the subsequent ef

fects range from whimsical to deadly.

ELDRITCH STORMS

When magical currents become trapped amid

winds and clouds, eldritch storms can result.

Flaywind. Supernaturally powerful winds-

like those from planes such as Pandemonium or

Minethys, the third layer of Carceri can spawn

flaywinds. A flaywind is an intense sandstorm,

gathering large rocks and other debris in addition

to sand or grit. The area within the storm is heavily

obscured, and a creature exposed to the storm takes

ld4 slashing damage at the start of each of its turns.

Only substantial cover or shelter offers protection

against the flensing grit.

A flaywind leaves 4d6 feet of sand or debris in its

wake. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or

(Nature) check or Wisdom (Survival) check allows

a character to recognize a flaywind 1 minute before

it strikes, allowing time to seek shelter. A flaywind

typically lasts ld4 x 10 hours.

Flame Storm. Sooty thunderclouds shot through

with red and orange lightning release a deluge of

fiery droplets. Any creature caught in the burning

rain takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of

its turns. The droplets ignite any flammable objects

that aren't being worn or carried; otherwise, the

droplets burn out immediately. The smoke, soot,

crackle, and low roar of the storm impose disadvan

tage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and ranged

attack rolls.

A flame storm usually lasts 2d4 minutes, though

the originating storm clouds can persist for days,

creating multiple flame storms.

Necrotic Tempest. Storms infused with the es

sence of death roil with dark clouds that manifest

leering skulls and bone-white lightning. Any crea

ture exposed to the storm that isn't a construct or

an undead must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution

saving throw at the end of each minute or take 3d6

necrotic damage.

A creature that dies in a necrotic tempest rises

as a skeleton or zombie (your choice) ldlO min

utes later.

A necrotic tempest lasts for ld4 hours and leaves

crops withered and wells undrinkable for ld4 days

after its passing.

Thrym's Howl. These bone-chilling blizzards

drive a wall of wind and snow like a living glacier.

The storm projects extreme cold (see the Dungeon

Master's Guide). Due to the howling wind and

dense blue-white ice particles, the area in the storm

CHAPTER 4 ]  DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS

is heavily obscured, and ranged attack rolls and

Wisdom (Perception) checks made within it have

disadvantage.

Any creature exposed to the storm at the start of

its turn takes 2d6 cold damage and can't regain hit

points until it spends at least 1 hour in a warm en

vironment. A creature that dies in the storm freezes

solid. Creatures that are immune to cold damage

are immune to the effects of the storm and can see

normally within it.

Thrym's howl typically lasts 2dl0 hours.

EMOTIONAL ECHOES

Occasionally a place becomes infused with the pow

erful emotions of those who once dwelt, worked,

celebrated, or suffered there. Areas with emotional

echoes are typically associated with one common

emotion, such as joy or sorrow. Such an area might

be as small as a room in a house or as large as a

forest. Once per day,  if a creature within the area

expresses even the faintest hint of the prevailing

emotion, the land seeks to hold onto that creature

and inspire it to produce more of the feeling tied to

the emotional echo. The creature is targeted by a

suggestion spell (DC 16), with the intent of making

it linger in the area and perform an act related to its

associated emotion. The effect lasts 24 hours.

CHAPTER 4 I  DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS

The following list notes some of the most common

emotional echoes, where they tend to appear, and

how they typically influence creatures:

Boldness: Appears in battlefields and echoing

canyons, encouraging creatures to shout hidden

truths and act out their greatest victories

Doubt: Appears around cliffs or deserts and makes

creatures hesitate, mistrusting their ability to

climb or escape their current difficulties

Fear: Appears in caves and ruins, overwhelming

creatures with dread and urging them to give

voice to their deepest fears

Hatred: Appears in volcanic regions and provokes

creatures to scream and destroy things

Inspiration: Appears around memorials or natural

wonders, causing creatures to create works of art

on the spot and obsess over them

Joy: Appears in glens or flowering fields, inspiring

creatures to dance, relax, and sing

Love: Appears along beaches or orchards and en

courages creatures to confess their love to others

and endlessly list their favorite things

Sorrow: Appears in ruins and swamps, particularly

around quicksand, and overwhelms creatures

with sobbing and confessions of regret

ENCHANTED  SPRINGS

Enchanted springs brim with miraculous waters,

whether they tap into magical sources hidden be

neath the earth or they're blessed by eldritch beings.

Those who find these mystical sites might bathe or

drink from the pools and temporarily gain a mea

sure of the waters' magic. All manner of protectors

or covetous guardians might lurk around these

springs, driving off strangers or demanding a wor

thy price for access to the mystical waters.

While many enchanted springs bear the blessings

of wild gods or fey beings, some are tainted. These

might be waters that were long ago polluted by the

ichor of an evil entity. As with pristine enchanted

springs, folk seek out such defiled places, whether

to purify them or claim their foul powers.

Regardless of whether a spring is pure or tainted,

creatures might need to drink the water to experi

ence the spring's effects, simply touch the water, or

bathe in it for a minute to trigger an effect.

Bottling an enchanted spring's water removes its

magical properties, unless the bottle is a specially

prepared vial blessed by whatever being enchanted

the spring in the first place.

ENCHANTED SPRING  EFFECTS

from a creature's head. The flowers smell lovely,

and they renew their vitality and scent every day.

The flowers vanish after 7 days.

A creature that touches or drinks the water of this

spring grows ld4 eyestalks. These eyestalks let the

creature see in all directions and grant it advantage

on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

The eyestalks vanish after ld4 days.

Bathing in the spring causes a creature's voice to

sound sinister.  For the next 24 hours, the crea

ture's voice grants it advantage on Charisma (In

timidation) checks and disadvantage on Charisma

(Deception) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks.

A creature that touches or drinks the water of this

spring grows a set of donkey ears. The ears grant

the creature advantage on Wisdom (Perception)

checks that rely on hearing. The ears vanish after

ld4 days.

Bathing in the spring causes a creature to develop

a third eye on its forehead. The eye grants the

creature truesight out to a range of 60 feet. The eye

vanishes after 24 hours.

MAGIC MUSHROOMS

Mushrooms can be deadly, delicious, or both. Some

have magical properties, especially those that grow

in areas suffused by mystical energy, such as the

Underdark and the Feywild.

Creatures proficient in the Medicine, Nature, or

Survival skills might be versed on the subject of

fungi, especially the magical kind, since the benefi

cial effects can save lives or bestow unusual powers.

But when an unknown variety of fungus is encoun

tered, only an expert can identify it and determine

its properties.

To determine the effects of eating such fungus,

roll on the Magic Mushroom Effects table.

MIMIC  COLONIES

Mimics imitate terrain and dungeon dressing to

hunt for food. Rare specimens develop a deeper un

derstanding of the world and can communicate with

other creatures. In extremely rare cases, groups of

these creatures band together, creating colonies.

These bonded mimics cooperate to create larger

objects than any lone mimic could approximate. A

mimic colony can work together to form buildings,

bridges, crystal formations, cliff faces, statues, and

nearly anything it desires. Entire villages appearing

out of nowhere might be composed of mimics!

Mimic Communication. Members of the colony

develop telepathy and the ability to speak. While

within 10 miles of the colony, any mimic can com

municate telepathically with other creatures within

120 feet of it and can speak Common and Under

common fluently (or two other languages of the

DM's choice). The colony's offspring gain these abil

ities innately and can use them even away from the

colony, as shown in the Juvenile Mimic stat block.

Confronting a Colony. A mimic colony's primary

goal is survival. If threatened by a force the mimics

can't overcome, they are willing to bargain. Mimic

colonies have learned that adventurers they can't de

feat can be bought off with information about nearby

creatures or locations, hidden treasure (which the

colony obtained from prior "food"), or even one of

their own young.

If the colony's survival is threatened and it thinks

it has a chance of surviving a fight, it can leverage its

combined might using special lair actions. On initia

tive count 20 (losing all ties), the mimic colony takes

a lair action, causing one of the following effects; it

can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

The mimic colony chooses up to three creatures

within 300 feet of it. Each target must succeed on

a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have its speed

reduced to O until initiative count 20 on the follow

ing round, as pieces of the environment grasp the

target. If a target fails the save by 5 or more, it is

restrained instead for that duration.

The mimic colony uses the Help action, aiding a

creature of its choice within 300 feet of it.

The mimic colony chooses up to three creatures

within 300 feet of it. Each target must succeed on

a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8)

acid damage, as orifices appear on surfaces in the

environment and launch caustic spittle.

The mimic colony chooses a cube of nonmagical,

inanimate material in physical contact with it. The

cube can be up to 15 feet on a side. The colony re

shapes that material however it likes. This trans

formation lasts for 1 hour.

When determining the difficulty of an encounter

with a hostile mimic colony, consider the colony to

be one additional creature of challenge rating 2.

CHAPTER 4  ]  DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS

PRIMAL FRUIT

In wild places brimming with nature's power, gar

dens meticulously tended by eccentric wizards, and

blessed groves touched by divine providence, plants

can sometimes produce fruit bursting with primal

magic. Not every fruit-bearing plant holds this

stored magic, but those that do bear obvious signs:

their colors are more vibrant or shift randomly, their

skin sparkles in the light or glows in the dark, soft

hums emanate from them, or they feel peculiar to

the touch.

A fruit-bearing plant that is suffused with magic

might produce ld6 pieces of primal fruit every

week. Primal fruit remains potent for 1 week,

after which it loses its magical properties but re

mains edible.

As an action, a creature can eat a piece of primal

fruit to gain its effects. This fruit can be squeezed

into juice or cooked into a dish and retains its

magic. Choose an effect or roll on the Primal Fruit

Effects table to determine what happens when a

piece of the fruit is consumed. An identify spell or

similar magic reveals the beneficial effect of a piece

of fruit before it is eaten, but it doesn't reveal a curse

or side effect.

on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poi

soned for the duration.

A faint humming drones in the background of

everything the creature hears for l hour,  during

which the creature has advantage on saving throws

against spells.

The creature doesn't require food, drink, or sleep

for ld4 days. For the duration, the creature can't

be put to sleep by magic, and its dreams intrude

upon its waking thoughts, imposing disadvantage

on its Wisdom (Perception) checks.

8  Whispers intrude on the creature's mind for 24

hours. For the duration, the creature can tele

pathically communicate with any creature it can

see within 120 feet ofit.  If the other creature un

derstands at least one language, it can respond

telepathically.

UNEARTHLY ROADS

Currents of magic run through the world-invisible,

artery-like networks that exert subtle influence and

connect disparate lands. The greatest of these mag

ical streams are persistent paths, often known by

colloquial names or simply as unearthly roads. An

unearthly road acts like a sort of planar portal that

stretches from one place to another, be they sites on

the same world or on different planes of existence.

Unearthly roads allow creatures to cross great dis-

tances rapidly, moving from an entrance gate to an

exit gate or visa versa. These paths operate like long

tunnels, and a creature that travels on an unearthly

road progresses 21 miles of distance in the time it

would normally take it to travel 1 mile. While on the

road, glimpses of the world beyond might be visible

in blurred or distorted visions of scenery or espe

cially prominent landmarks. Creatures or specific

details are not visible beyond an unearthly road.

Some unearthly roads serve as trade routes or se

cret connections between distant lands. Others shift

locations at noteworthy times or in response to ex

ternal phenomena, like on specific anniversaries or

in response to the phases of the moon. Some might

also require a particular item, ritual, or action to

open their gates. The Unearthly Road Keys table of

fers suggestions on how to enter an unearthly road.

NATURAL HAZARDS

Even without the threats of supernatural environ

ments, the world is a dangerous place. The follow

ing natural hazards expand on those presented in

the Dungeon Masters Guide.

AVALANCHES

A typical avalanche (or rockslide) is 300 feet wide,

150 feet long, and 30 feet thick. Creatures in the

path of an avalanche can avoid it or escape it if

they're close to its edge, but outrunning one is al

most impossible.

When an avalanche occurs, all nearby creatures

must roll initiative. Twice each round, on initiative

counts 10 and O, the avalanche travels 300 feet until

it can travel no more. When an avalanche moves,

any creature in its space moves along with it and

falls prone, and the creature must make a DC 15

Strength saving throw, taking ldlO bludgeoning

damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on

a successful one.

When an avalanche stops, the snow and other

debris settle and bury creatures. A creature buried

in this way is blinded and restrained, and it has total

cover. The creature gains 1 level of exhaustion for

every 5 minutes it spends buried. It can try to dig it

self free as an action, breaking the surface and end

ing the blinded and restrained conditions on itself

CHAPTER 4 ]  DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS

with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

A creature that fails this check three times can't at

tempt to dig itself out again.

A creature that is not restrained or incapacitated

can spend 1 minute freeing a buried creature. Once

free, that creature is no longer blinded or restrained

by the avalanche.

FALLING INTO WATER

A creature that falls into water or another liquid can

use its reaction to make a DC 15 Strength (Athlet

ics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to hit the surface

head or feet first. On a successful check, any dam

age resulting from the fall is halved.

FALLING ONTO A CREATURE

If a creature falls into the spacc of a sccond crcaturc

and neither of them is Tiny, the second creature

must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or

be impacted by the falling creature, and any damage

resulting from the fall is divided evenly between

them. The impacted creature is also knocked prone,

unless it is two or more sizes larger than the fall-

ing creature.

SPELL EQUIVALENTS OF NATURAL HAZARDS

Numerous spells emulate the wrath of nature, and

you can use spell effects to represent a variety of

natural hazards. The Spells as Natural Hazards ta

PUZZLES

Why create a Solvable puzzle? Jut pose an eiqmatic

quefio without a a\wer ad watch uour

trespasser$ Squirm!

TASHA

Devious traps and multifaceted mysteries might

be staples of fantasy adventures, but they're not

the easiest challenges for a DM to present on the

fly. This section presents a selection of puzzles de

signed to invite group participation and challenge

adventurers of any stripe-from genius scholars to

martial masters. Each puzzle is flexible enough to

be included in your campaign as presented Or CuS

tomized to fit the needs of a specific adventure.

WHY USE PUZZLES?

Puzzles provide exciting opportunities to use wit to

overcome obstacles and allow characters to collabo

rate to make discoveries. You might add a puzzle to

an adventure for any of the following reasons:

To encourage a party to discover information

through teamwork

To provide an opportunity for characters to use

their skills in uncommon ways

To make a setting feel more whimsical, mysteri

ous, or otherworldly

To explain why no one has ever discovered some

thing hidden close at hand

To reveal a secret no one knows and magic

can't reveal

Some puzzles can take considerable time to solve,

so be mindful of how often you use them in your ad

ventures. Remember, most puzzles don't need to be

solved immediately, and they might be all the more

satisfying if their riddles linger unresolved for multi

ple sessions.

PUZZLE ELEMENTS

Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read

aloud or paraphrased for the players when their char

acters first arrive in a location with a puzzle or when

otherwise noted.

Additionally, the following sections appear in

each puzzle:

Difficulty. Each puzzle is classified as easy, me

dium, or hard. The harder the puzzle, the more

likely the players will need hints to solve it.

Puzzle Features. This section presents an overview

of the puzzle's features and how they can be inter

acted with.

Solution. This section explains how the puzzle

is solved.

Hint Checks. This section suggests hints that char

acters might use their skills to reveal. Provide one

or more of the hints if the characters get stuck. If

a character has proficiency in a hint's associated

skill, give them that hint if they ask you for help.

Customizing the Puzzle. This section explores how

to integrate the puzzle into your adventures, alter

its difficulty, or make other adjustments.

HINTS

If players request a hint while attempting to solve

a puzzle, consult that puzzle's "Hint Checks" sec

tion. Each hint is associated with a skill and a DC.

If a character in the party has proficiency in a skill

related to a hint, share that hint with them. If the

same skill is listed multiple times with the same or

higher DCs, reveal hints with the lowest DCs first

then hints with higher DCs if the group requests

additional help.

If no character has proficiency in any of the listed

skills, characters can make ability checks using

the listed skills and DCs. Those who succeed on a

check learn the associated hint.

Don't hesitate to reveal hints to the party. Hints

provide characters with relevant skills the opportu

nity to shine, even if they're not usually particularly

cunning. Additionally, if party members have back

grounds or campaign experiences that might tie into

a puzzle, those make great reasons to provide char

acters with additional hints.

RUNNING PUZZLES

Once you've presented a puzzle to a group, feel free

to add and clarify details as you would in any other

type of encounter. Try not to give away details of the

puzzle's solution in your descriptions, but there's

nothing wrong with letting a hint slip here or there.

Don't worry whether it's a player or a character

who's solving a puzzle. While hint checks provide

a way for character experience to contribute to a

puzzle's solution, ultimately the boundaries between

a player's and a character's ability to solve a puzzle

isn't as important as the group enjoying the chal

lenge. However, if a player knows the answer to a

puzzle in advance, urge them to share only hints

their character learns.

After presenting a puzzle, encourage the party

to solve it together, to pool hints, and to share their

insights. Work with the group to share any puzzle

handouts and to take turns talking through their

thoughts. Ultimately, solving a puzzle will be a vic

tory for the whole group, not one individual.

CHAPTER 4 [  DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS

CREATURE PAINTINGS

Difficulty: Easy

This short puzzle works anywhere that makes sense

for characters to peruse several paintings, such as

in a museum or manor. These paintings could even

appear in a sketchbook found in a dusty old drawer.

This counting puzzle leads to a name of a creature.

Fit this into your campaign by making the name

of the creature the first item on a scavenger hunt or

the first clue in a larger mystery.

This gallery is decorated with seven framed paintings

of creatures. A few chairs and benches have been

placed in front of the art for viewing.

A plaque mounted on one of the walls bears the

following dedication: "In order to gain all knowledge,

one must know where to start. Count on your enemies

to reveal the source of the secret. This room is dedi

cated to the defeat of all  monsters within."

Characters should be free to explore the gallery and

inspect the paintings and dedication to discover the

parts of the puzzle.

PUZZLE FEATURES

There are seven paintings on the walls. The paint

ings feature a gruesome werewolf under a full

moon, a trio of gnolls fighting over a spear, a grin

ning beholder, two trolls sitting under a tree, five

kobolds around a bonfire, two gelatinous cubes

patrolling a dungeon corridor, and three dragons

in flight.

SOLUTION

Each painting features a number of creatures of

a particular kind, as summarized in the Creature

Paintings table. Counting into each creature's name

by the number of creatures in the painting reveals a

letter. When unscrambled, the letters spell out "owl-

bear' Characters are likely to reveal these letters in

random order. Arranging them in the correct order

is part of the puzzle.

CHAPTER 4 I  DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS

SIGNIFICANCE OF "OWLBEAR"

This puzzle's solution, "owlbear,"  might be the pass

phrase to bypass a future trap or unlock a magically

sealed door. It might also be a clue that points to

a hidden treasure. For example, there might be a

stuffed owlbear in another room that has treasure

hidden inside it.

HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability

checks to receive a hint:

Intelligence (Investigation) DC 10. The charac-

ter deduces that the number of creatures in a

painting is important and uses that number to

determine which letter of the creature's name they

should review.

Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. When looking at the

dedication, the words "count on" alert the charac

ter that they should count the creatures.

CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

You can replace the monsters in the artwork with

distinctive objects, members of obvious professions,

and anything else that might logically be in a group.

Then, follow the letter-counting method detailed in

this puzzle to determine how many subjects should

feature in each piece of art.

RECKLESS STEPS

Difficulty: Easy

This puzzle features a word search on floor tiles,

which might present a barrier to exploration in

myriad scenarios. To cross safely, characters must

first uncover what words they're searching for and

then find them in the tiles.

You enter a cobweb-filled room lit by torches on oppo

site walls. Dust on the floor has collected in grooves

that cover rows of five-foot-square tiles. On the oppo

site wall, a solitary arch leads from the room. One wall

bears the following inscription:

Eight appear before your eyes,

And eight remain in schooled disguise.

Avoid all magic in this room,

Lest reckless steps ensure your doom.

The tiles covering the floor of this room each bear a

single letter written in the Common alphabet, mak

ing the room a giant word search. Traps beneath

many of the tiles threaten those who move through

the room heedless of the hidden words.

PUZZLE FEATURES

The floor of this 60-foot-by-70-foot room is made

of 5-foot-square stone tiles laid out in a grid. Each

tile has a letter chiseled into it, as shown in puzzle

handout 1 at the end of this chapter. Place a copy of

the handout for this puzzle on the table, and allow

players to use miniatures to show how their charac

ters navigate the room.

To safely walk across the room, a character must

step on the correct tiles. Stepping on an incorrect

tile sets off a trap.

TRAPS

Certain tiles (as indicated in this trap's "Solution"

section) are trapped. A trapped tile is triggered

when more than 20 pounds of weight are placed

on it, activating the pressure plate underneath and

causing jets of poisonous gas to spout from the

cracks between the tiles. Any creature above the

trapped floor tile or one of its adjacent tiles must

make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11

(2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as

much damage on a successful one.

As an action, a character can disable a trap with

a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves'

tools. If a character fails to disable the trap, the tile's

trap can no longer be disabled.

Characters can attempt to jump over trapped tiles,

using the jump rules in the Player's Handbook.

SOLUTION

The only safe tiles for characters to step on are the

ones with the faded black letters in diagram 4.1.

Red letters spell out either "magic" or one of the

schools of magic: abjuration, conjuration, divination,

enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, and

transmutation. Stepping on one of these tiles trig

gers a poison trap, as described earlier.

HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability

checks to receive a hint:

Intelligence (Arcana) DC 10. The character sees

one instance of a school of magic on the floor.

Intelligence (Investigation) DC 10. The character

interprets the clue in the wall verse: there are

eight schools of magic.

Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. Each character who

succeeds on this check sees an instance of the

word "magic" in the floor.

CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

Consider using this puzzle's structure to create any

number of thematic word searches hiding deadly

traps. Once you've created a hint suggesting what

types of words to look for, it's a simple matter to cre

ate your own grid of hidden words.

RAISING THE DIFFICULTY

You can increase this puzzle's difficulty by changing

the word search's letters to use another alphabet,

such as those presented in the Player's Handbook.

Alternatively, you can create an entirely new code to

replace the letters, requiring the characters to find a

cipher to reveal the tiles' meanings before they can

undertake the puzzle and cross the room safely.

You can also increase the difficulty by introducing

trap variants, as described below.

TRAP VARIANTS

Rather than have the same poison gas trap on every

trapped tile, each word can have a distinct trap as

sociated with it, as described below:

Magic. The trap triggers normally, as described in

this puzzle's "Traps" section.

Abjuration. The trap casts dispel magic on each

creature in the room, using a 9th-level spell slot.

Conjuration. The trap teleports the creature that

triggered it back to the entrance of the room. That

creature must also make a DC 15 Constitution

saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) force damage on

a failed save, or half as much damage on a suc

cessful one.

1

Divination. The creature that triggered the trap

must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving

throw or be unable to perceive any of the letters

174

CHAPTER 4  I  DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS

DIAGRAM 4.1;  RECKLESS  STEPS  PUZZLE  SOLUTION

on the tiles by sight or touch. Any magic that ends

a curse ends this effect on the character. A player

whose character is affected by this trap should not

be allowed to reference the accompanying player

handout until the effect on that character ends.

Enchantment. The trap casts suggestion (save DC

15) on the creature that triggered it. On a failed

save, a gentle voice only the creature can hear tells

it to move 5 feet in a random direction. This move

ment might cause it to trigger another trap.

Evocation. Magical fire erupts from the trapped tile.

The creature that triggered this trap must suc

ceed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw,  taking

11 (2d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as

much damage on a successful one.

Illusion. A suit of animated armor appears in an

unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature

that set off this trap. The armor attacks only the

creature that summoned it and can't leave the

room. It doesn't set off any of the room's traps and

disappears if it takes any damage. Otherwise, it

lasts for 1 minute.

Necromancy. Any creature that triggers this trap

hears a banshee's wail in its mind. Unless the

creature is a construct or undead, it must succeed

on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.  On a fail

ure, the creature drops to O hit points. On a suc

cess, it takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage.

Transmutation. The trap casts polymorph (save DC

15) on the creature that triggered it. On a failed

save, the creature turns into a giant frog.

HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability

checks to receive a hint:

Intelligence (Nature) DC 10. The character knows

that "natural" knowledge about bats, snakes, spi

ders, and wolves in general won't help here.

Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. The character real

izes that the keys' skull-shaped heads are all the

same and probably have no bearing on the puz

zle's solution.

CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

The focal parts of this puzzle are the locks and keys,

not the chest. You could easily convert this puzzle

to feature any types of locks, be they on doors, cells,

books, or some more esoteric barrier.

Beyond the form the locks and keys take, you

might also consider adjusting the creatures depicted

with each lock to suit your adventures. Just keep

in mind that the number of teeth on each key must

match the number of letters in your substitutions,

and those substitutions should be things the charac

ters can identify.

RAISING THE DIFFICULTY

Rather than associating each lock with a particular

image of a creature, consider presenting a riddle

alongside each lock. The answer to each riddle

should be the related creature's name, allowing

characters to match the riddles' answers to the

proper keys.

SKELETON KEYS

Difficulty: Easy

This puzzle presents a quick encounter useful for

providing treasure or information. It features a box

with four locks.

You come upon a sinister metal box with an iron lock

built into each of its four sides. Each lock sports a

keyhole with a sculpted image above it. Four iron keys

hang from hooks on a nearby wall, and each key has a

different number of teeth. Above the keys, the follow

ing verse has been etched into the wall:

The spells on these locks are all the same.

Though each possesses a unique name.

Count on your answer to unlock the way,

But use the wrong key to your dismay.

All four locks must be opened before the box's con

tents (whatever they might be) can be accessed.

PUZZLE FEATURES

Show the players puzzle handout 2 (see the end of

this chapter) when their characters examine the

keys. Each key has a different number of teeth: six,

five, four, and three, respectively.

Each lock has a creature molded in iron above it: a

bat, snake, spider, or wolf, respectively. These locks

can't be picked. If anything other than the correct

key is placed inside a lock, creatures corresponding

to the image above the lock (ld4 giant bats, ld4

giant poisonous snakes, ld4 giant wolf spiders,

or ld4 wolves) are summoned into the room. Each

summoned creature is hostile and disappears after

10 minutes or when reduced to O hit points. These

beasts can't be charmed or frightened.

SOLUTION

Once the characters identify the creature depicted

above each lock, they should count the letters in

each creature's name. The number of letters in a

creature's name corresoonds to the number of teeth

on the correct key, as shown in the Skeleton Keys

Solution table.

ALL THAT GLITTERS

Difficulty: Medium

This gem-filled room can be placed in any dungeon,

estate, or building with multiple rooms and might

serve as both a trap and a place to obtain a reward.

Dozens of gems lie strewn upon the floor. Amid the

treasure stands a marble statue with its hands clasped

in front of it. A placard at the statue's base reads,

"Only one treasure may leave this room. Cross with

another and find your tomb."

PUZZLE FEATURES

The statue, which is impervious to damage, depicts

Ioun or some other god of knowledge or order.

Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelli

gence (Religion) check can identify the figure be

ing depicted.

DIAMOND

Between the palms of the statue's clasped hands is

a diamond, which can only be found and retrieved

once the puzzle is solved. Once the characters solve

the puzzle, the statue's hands open, allowing the

diamond to be taken. Upon breaching the threshold

of the room with the diamond, a trapped soul in

the form of a friendly, thankful spirit is released.

The spirit leaves to pursue its own goals, and the

diamond is left behind as a reward. The diamond is

worth 5,000 gp.

GEMSTONES

An inventory of the room reveals the following gem

stones scattered across the floor: eighteen pieces of

jade, sixteen onyxes, fourteen amethysts, thirteen

sapphires, twelve rubies, nine pieces of amber, eight

citrines, five garnets, and one piece of quartz.

If a creature attempts to leave the room with any

of these stones, the gem disappears and an angry

spirit trapped inside it is released. The spirit man

ifests as a hostile unctead creature of your choice,

such as a ghost, specter, or skeleton. When this

creature is reduced to O hit points, its form dissi

pates, leaving no trace of itself behind.

NAMED SPIRITS

Characters hear each spirit whisper its name before

it dissipates. The names themselves are not import

ant, other than they must start with the appropriate

letter of the alphabet.

The following list provides names for all the im

prisoned spirits, each name starting with the letter

associated with the spirit's gemstone prison:

SOLUTION

An inventory of the room reveals gemstones in

the amounts shown in the Gem Inventory table.

The table lists the gems in alphabetical order, but

you should list them in any other order when de

scribing them to players so not to accidentally give

away a hint.

Each type of gem is associated with a letter of the

alphabet, and each gem's letter is revealed by count

ing into the alphabet by a number of letters equal to

the number of gems of its type. For example, there

is one piece of quartz, so "quartz" corresponds to

the first letter of the alphabet (A), while there are

fourteen amethysts, so "amethyst" corresponds to

the fourteenth letter of the alphabet (N).

Once the gems are sorted by type and alphabet

ized, characters can count into the alphabet by how

many of each are in the room to reveal the words

"in her palm." When a character speaks this phrase

aloud, the statue's folded hands open, revealing the

previously hidden diamond.

HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability

checks to receive a hint:

Intelligence (Arcana) DC 15. The character can

determine that there are spirits imprisoned in the

gemstones scattered on the floor.

Intelligence (Religion) DC 10. The character

knows that the statue represents a god of knowl

edge and order, and the character has a strong

feeling that the order of the gems in the room is

important.

Wisdom (Insight) DC 10. The character senses that

the number of each type of gem isn't arbitrary.

------=--=====--------

CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

This puzzle explores how to use groups of objects

to disguise a message. So long as your groups can

be arranged in a logical order (like the gems being

arranged alphabetically in this puzzle), all you must

do is adjust the number of items to correspond to

a particular letter of the alphabet. Alternatively,

perhaps another organizing principle orders your

groups. For example, tombstones that feature vary

ing numbers of skulls might be arranged by dates,

while stacks of books might be ordered by shared

page-counts. These details can be easy to miss,

though, so make sure you present a riddle or other

signpost to make sure your players notice there's a

puzzle at hand.

LOWERING THE DIFFICULTY

To make the puzzle easier to solve, a spirit can pro

vide a hint in addition to giving its name. Coaxing a

hint from a spirit requires a successful DC 15 Cha

risma (Persuasion or Intimidation) check. Consider

hints like "A is the first letter in the alphabet" and

"The gemstones, in order, will help for a spell."

RELEASING THE SPIRITS

If the characters don't attempt to remove gems from

the room, or if they spend too long deliberating, cre

ate a new trigger to release the spirits. For example,

perhaps .a spirit is released if a character places a

gem near the statue or if it's held for too long.

EYE OF THE BEHOLDER

Difficulty: Medium

This map puzzle is designed to lead a party through

a dungeon where a roaming beholder doesn't wish

to be disturbed. A series of clues tie to the word

"eye,"  and the characters must determine how to get

through the area safely.

A disorienting wave sweeps over you. Suddenly,

your surroundings are unfamiliar and shrouded

in shadows.

Out of the gloom appears a hooded goblin carrying

a lantern.

"Hello, friends!" the goblin says. "I  can help you

through these parts--if you can figure out my riddles.

You don't want to make a wrong turn in here, as there

are eyes everywhere. Solve the riddles and follow my

directions to the letter."

The goblin is friendly, and its offer is genuine. It's

name is Igor (pronounced eye-gor), which it reveals

only if asked. The characters find themselves in

a maze that emits magical darkness that can't be

dispelled. No vision can penetrate this darkness,

and only the goblin's lantern can illuminate it. Igor's

lantern emits light in a 5-foot radius, but only so

long as the goblin holds it. The lantern goes dark if

any other creature takes custody of it.

PUZZLE FEATURES

The magical maze the characters find themselves in

is comprised of an endless series of identical cham

bers. Each chamber has four passages, one at each

cardinal direction. The goblin guide poses riddles

that can lead the party along the path that ultimately

CHAPTER 4 I  DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS

..

au@ ere

"g .  ms

f

exits the maze. Each time the party moves through

the correct passage and enters a new room, the gob

lin provides them with a new riddle that hints which

direction to travel in next. If they make an error,

the characters encounter a monster of your choice

and then must backtrack from their last correct

turn. After three wrong turns, the party encounters

the beholder.

HALLWAYS

The halls of this maze are 60 feet long and 10 feet

wide. If the characters move away from the guide

luring combat or for any other rcason, tho goblin

encourages them to follow him back to the last cor

rect turn.

Once the goblin has the characters' attention, it

provides the first riddle, then waits for the party to

venture down a passage of its choice. The goblin

stops at each intersection and either provides the

next riddle (if the party chose the correct path) or

avoids the monster the group encounters (if the

party chose the incorrect path), leading the charac

ters back to the last correct chamber along the path

after any battle.

The goblin's riddles (and their answers) are

as follows:

What beast has the sharpest eye? (Eagle)

Threads get pulled through the eye of

what? (Needle)

What is the eye to the soul? (Window)

Whose eye matters to a witch's brew? (Newt)

This eye curses you with misfortune. (Evil)

This eye brings a temporary calm. (Storm)

Roll a one on a six-sided die. Roll another and get

the same. Take both together, and what's their

name? (Snake eyes)

SOLUTION

The answer to each riddle begins with a letter in

dicating the direction of the path the characters

should follow next. The path provided by the riddles'

answers takes the following route: east, north, west,

north, east, south, south. This path leads the charac

ters through some chambers more than once, which

is a necessary part of the magic that will allow them

to escape.

HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability

checks to receive a hint:

Charisma (Persuasion) DC 15. The goblin provides

a hint in the form of a synonym of the riddle's an

swer (for example, "lizard" for "newt").

Intelligence (Investigation) DC 10. After a few rid

dles are answered correctly, a character notices

that all the answers relate to eyes.

Wisdom (Insight) DC 15. After one or more correct

answers are given, the character realizes that

each answer corresponds to a cardinal direction.

THE GOBLIN'S RIDDLES

Upon meeting the characters (and to discourage

them from attacking), the goblin makes it clear

there is no way out of the maze without his help.

Characters can determine that the goblin is sincere

in wanting to help with a successful DC 10 Wisdom

(Insight) check.

CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

The characters can easily persuade the goblin to

join their party. What other secrets does the goblin

know? Does he have an agenda for helping the char

acters find their freedom? And why has he lingered

in the maze if he knows the way out? There might

be more to this guide than meets the eye.

This puzzle is easily situated in a dungeon, a dusty

mausoleum, or an abandoned shrine.

You enter a dimly lit chamber.  Nine dwarf skulls

rest near a four-foot-square set of tiles in the floor,

and carved into a nearby stone altar is the following

inscription:

Brave warriors met their demise foretold.

Their secret kept shall yet unfold.

If crowns placed correctly on the shrine,

Celestial beds for four of nine.

Solving this puzzle causes a secret compartment in

this chapter). Columns and rows in the grid are la

beled with the markings I, II, or III.

SOLUTION

The numbers labeling each row and column denote

how many skulls belong within. Characters must

place the skulls so that the correct number of skulls

appear both in the rows and columns, while still

covering four of the stars. This puzzle has multiple

possible solutions, with one shown in diagram 4.2.

HINT CHECKS

Dwarf characters have advantage on ability checks

to gain hints in this room. Any character has the op

tion of making these ability checks to receive a hint:

Intelligence (Investigation) DC 15. The verse indi

cates to the character that four of the skulls need

to rest on tiles engraved with stars.

Wisdom (Insight) DC 15. The I, II, and III mark

ings around the edge of the grid likely denote

how many skulls must be placed in those rows

and columns.

CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

If one of the characters is a dwarf, this might be

the perfect time to bring in a familial storyline. Are

these the skulls of their long-lost clan? Does one of

the skulls belong to a relative that they have been

seeking? And what do they think the puzzle is im

plying with only four of the nine skulls receiving

"celestial beds"?

ILLUSIVE ISLAND

Difficulty:  Medium

Three numerical dials seal a box, door, or other

locked object. Figuring out the correct combination

is the goal of this puzzle, as there are no visible

locks to pick.

PUZZLE FEATURES

The numbers the dials are originally set to don't

matter. If the players ask, choose any three digits

you please.

A corked wooden tube contains two clues: a map

of an island and a set of directions.

MAP

Give the players a copy of puzzle handout 4 (see the

end of this chapter). This map depicts an unfamiliar

island with various landmarks but no key.

DIRECTIONS

The directions are written on a single sheet of

parchment and recount the route a group took in

their search for treasure:

Day 1. Our search for the lost treasure began at the

northwest inlet, Wind staff Cove. After unloading our

necessities, we traveled east to Lone Pine, then south

west past North ridge to the Palms Oasis. As evening

approached, we continued southeast to Anchor Point,

then camped in the Great Dunes.

Day 2. In the morning, we arose at the Dunes and

headed to Deadman's Cave. After finding it empty, our

party continued to the Golden Ziggurat. Heading due

east, we made camp at the Swirling Sands.

Day 3. After a strange night's sleep, we awoke on

the third day back at Anchor Point with no memory

DIAGRAM  4.3:  ILLUSIVE  ISLAND  PUZZLE  SOLUTION

HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability

checks to receive a hint:

Intelligence (Investigation) DC 10. The word

"trace" from the Day 3 entry strikes the character

as important, suggesting that the map is meant to

be drawn on.

Wisdom (Insight) DC 15. The map doesn't have

labels, which means the names of the landmarks

aren't significant. What's important are their posi

tions relative to one another.

Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. The fact that the ex

pedition lasted three days is significant, as there

are three dials.

Wisdom (Survival) DC 15. The character knows

the directions don't represent an efficient way to

search an area and deduces the directions must

be presenting some sort of message.

or trace of traveling there. The Swirling Sands must

CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

have taken us in the night! We skirted the Swirling

Sands to reach the Red Tower but still  couldn't find

the treasure. Thinking that we may have overlooked

something in the cave, we headed back. From there,

we headed to the southern coast to see if the treasure

was at Kraken Point. Finding nothing, we returned to

Anchor Point. What awaited us there was unlike any

treasure we'd imagined.

SOLUTION

Characters who follow the directions and trace their

paths on the map reveal three numbers: 3, 4, and 8

(see diagram 4.3). Turning the dials to these num

bers in the same order opens the locked object.

Consider creating your own map and series of direc

tions to customize this puzzle. By crafting directions

that suit locations in your campaign's' setting, you

can create a puzzle that's integrated into your adven

ture's plot, using a map the characters might already

possess. Your version of the puzzle can add as many

digits and directions as you see fit, or it might reveal

letters, symbols, or short words, depending on the

complexity of your design.

RAISING THE DIFFICULTY

You can increase this puzzle's challenge by dividing

the map into pieces that need to be separately dis

covered, or the characters might need to learn the

directions from someone who personally explored

the island. As long as the order of locations doesn't

change, the code remains correct.

MATERIAL COMPONENTS

Difficulty: Medium

This puzzle might appear in a wizard's workshop,

study, or spellbook. The solution leads to a pass

word that reveals new or rare spells (such as those

in chapter 3). Alternatively, the password can be

used for any other function that fits with your story.

You find an old piece of paper bearing a list of spells

and components. Random letters are also scratched

quickly on the paper between the two lists. A message

at the top of the page says, "read untouched to gain

new spells."

DIAGRAM 4.4; MATERIAL COMPONENTS  PUZZLE  SOLUTION

PUZZLE FEATURES

The wizard's study is filled with spell components,

books, potions, and various odds and ends. While

the various supplies might help characters solve

the puzzle, the only item the characters need is the

parchment. If the puzzle is giving them grief, they

can take the parchment with them and find others

who can help them solve it.

BOOKCASES

All around the wizard's study are shelves and cases

filled with books, scrolls, and other supplies. A char

acter who makes a successful DC 12 Intelligence

(Arcana) check notices a spell component with no

gp value from the list (such as a chip of mica or a bit

of bat fur).

LISTS

The parchment has a list of spells and a list of

material components. However, the components to

the right don't match with the adjacent spells to the

left. The parchment itself doesn't have any magical

qualities, but the word it reveals potentially does.

Wizards and other spellcasters can identify the

correct spell components for any spell they know,

but they must succeed on the Intelligence (Arcana)

checks noted in the "Hint Checks" section below to

recall the correct material components for any less

familiar spells.

SOLUTION

Drawing a line from a spell to its material com

ponent crosses out letters that fall between the

columns, as shown in diagram 4.4. Once all spells

are connected to components, the untouched letters

spell out "presto," which, when said aloud with the

paper in hand, causes one or more spell scrolls

(or some other treasure of your choice) to magi

cally appear.

CHAPTER 4 I  DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS

HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability

checks to receive a hint:

Intelligence (Arcana) DC 10. The character recalls

up to three of the material components for spells

on the list they don't currently know.

Wisdom (Insight) DC 15.The character suspects

that the jumbled letters in the middle-or some

number of them-probably spell out a command

word, pass-phrase, or important clue.

Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. The character notices

that straight lines drawn between spells and mate

rial components cross through some of the letters

in the center.

CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

While spells and components make easy to associ

ate lists, you might also consider creating your own

version of this puzzle using paired sets of monsters

and creature types, planes of existence and their

native inhabitants, famous figures in a setting and

their homelands, and so forth.

LOWERING THE DIFFICULTY

If your party doesn't include characters with con

siderable magical expertise, consider adding art to

the room's walls or on decorative book covers that

reveal connections between the listed spells and

components. These images might give away a few

connections between the lists or lower the DCs of

the puzzle's hint checks.

RAISING THE DIFFICULTY

Rather than using common spells the characters

might be familiar with, a more challenging version

of this puzzle might feature lost spells or other lore

the party has no way of knowing. Only by consulting

experts, undertaking research, or further adventur

ing might the party reveal the connections between

the two lists.

MEMBERS ONLY

Difficulty: Medium

A secret club, cultist meeting, or thieves' guild re

quires a password to enter. In this puzzle, those

who guard a certain door are so secretive that they

change the password constantly,  fearing someone

might have infiltrated their members' ranks.

You watch a figure approach an oak door with a slide

window. The figure knocks, and a guard opens the

window and says, "Six." The figure replies, "Three."

The guard then opens the door, allowing the figure

to enter.

This building seems to have only one entrance: the

oak door with a small slide window. A guard opens

the window and speaks a seemingly random num

ber to anyone who knocks on the door.

PUZZLE FEATURES

Even after observing the building from all angles,

characters only see members entering through the

one door after speaking to the guard.

DOOR

The door is made of oak reinforced with 3-inch-wide

iron bars. Three deadbolts secure the door, which

is also barred from the inside, so there are no locks

that can be picked from the outside.

GUARD

A guard stands on the other side of the door around

the clock, and the only way to speak with the guard

is through the door's slide window. The guard can

be any sort of talking creature, such as an assassin,

a cult fanatic, or a thug. More monstrous options

include a bugbear, wereboar, or nycaloth.

If a character knocks on the door, the guard slides

open the window and gruffly gives a number, expect

ing the proper response. The guard gives a different

number each time someone knocks. Any proper

response grants a single character entry, and the

guard only allows one member to enter at a time.

Characters who provide incorrect answers and

attempt to enter again must disguise themselves

in some way or be refused entry. The guard only

willingly opens the door for someone who speaks

the correct password. The guard raises the alarm if

unauthorized people try to open or bypass the door,

calling six more guards to help defend the entrance.

MEMBERS

If the characters continue watching the door, they

see up to four more visitors approach it. To eaves

drop on each exchange, the characters must suc

ceed on a DC 12 group Dexterity (Stealth) check to

remain hidden; if the group check fails, the visitor

notices they're being observed and speaks quietly

enough that their answer can't be overheard.

Second Visitor. The guard opens the window and

says, "Twelve." The visitor responds with "Six"

and is allowed inside.

Third Visitor. The guard opens the window and

says, "Ten." The visitor responds with "Five" and

is turned away.

Fourth Visitor. The guard opens the window and

says, "Seven." The visitor responds with "Five"

and is allowed inside.

Fifth Visitor. The guard opens the window and

says, "Zero." The visitor responds with "One" and

is turned away.

EXACT CHANGE

Difficulty: Hard

This puzzle provides an elaborate, coin-based lock

to any sort of door, vault, or other barrier.

The door here ls locked and .has no handle. Instead,

there is a slot In the door with an engraving above

it that reads, "Insert exact change here." Nearby, a

wooden bowl  of coins rests atop a wooden table.

The tabletop is engraved with nine squares in a

three-by-three grid. Nailed to the table's leg is a piece

of parchment with the following instructions:

Fifteen per column, fifteen per row;

Diagonally,  the same is so.

A plea of warning to carefully count;

No two places may hold the same amount.

What coins in the center be fed through the door;

Exact change for passage or trouble galore.

PUZZLE FEATURES

The bowl on the table contains forty-five gold coins.

The puzzle requires that an exact number of coins

be fed into the slot into the door. If the wrong

amount is deposited, it triggers either an alarm or a

trap of your choice.

SOLUTION

Diagram 4.5 shows how to divide the forty-five coins

so that every square has a different amount and

each row and column adds up to fifteen.

SOLUTION

Each member that approaches the door is given

a number by the guard. There is no mathematical

equation here; the only valid response to a number

given by the guard is the number of letters in the

guard's number.

For example, one member was given the number

"six." There are three letters in the word "six," so

the password for that member is "three." More po

tential answers are provided in the Potential Pass

HINT CHECKS

deduces there is no mathematical equation that

connects the numbers exchanged between the

guard and visitors.

Wisdom (Insight) DC 15. The character suspects

that the answer has to do with the word, not

the number.

CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

Part of what makes this puzzle challenging is that it

misleads players into thinking they're overhearing

a mathematical equation. To figure out the solution,

they have to first overcome their own assumptions.

An casicr vcrsion of thi:s puzzle might involve

counting the letters in any type of word the guard

provides and responding with that number. Alter

natively, the response to the guard's number might

be any word with the same number of letters as that

number-for example, "five" has four letters, making

"duck" or "smog" suitable responses. The more your

puzzle plays with numbers as words rather than dig

its, the more challenging it's likely to be.

FOUR ELEMENTS

Difficulty: Hard

This puzzle might appear anywhere elementals of

earth, air, fire, and water serve as guardians. If the

puzzle isn't solved correctly, one or more of these

guardian elementals magically transform from stat

ues and attack the characters.

The door slams behind you as you enter this hexag

onal room. Four of the walls are covered in mosaics,

each depicting the destructive force of one of the four

elements. Four nine-foot-tall, stone statues of ele

mentals line the far wall across from the closed door.

Above the statues is a row of square tiles with triangu

lar symbols painted on them. Four of these tiles have

fallen off and lie strewn upon the floor, which bears

the following inscription:

Four elementals trapped in stone,

Their elements ordered to lock their home.

Even patterns against all odd,

A tile misplaced awakens its god.

In proper order safely seal these four,

Or best one of each to open the door.

Once the characters enter this room, the door be

hind them slams shut. It can be opened only by com

pleting this puzzle, and there are no other exits.

184

CHAPTER 4 ]  DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS

PUZZLE FEATURES

SOLUTION

The mosaics, statues, and tiles are described below

in greater detail.

MOSAICS

The four wall mosaics depict the following:

A water elemental crashes through a city wall in a

huge wave. In the center of the image is a triangle

pointing downward.

An earth elemental looms over a group of war

riors. A triangle pointing downward with a hori

zontal line through it is carved into its chest.

A fire elemental burns through a forest town.

In the center of the flames is a triangle point

ing upward.

An air elemental gusts through a stormy sky.

Within the clouds is a triangle pointing upward

with a line running horizontally through it.

STATUES

The statues are actual elementals magically bound

in stone. The magic that turned these elementals

into statues is slowly coming undone, as the tile pat

tern that binds them has fallen apart.

TILES

If the characters don't replace the four fallen tiles in

their proper sequence, all four statues revert to their

true forms at the same time and attack the charac

ters. The exact timing of this event is left to you, but

the characters should be given enough time to take

a crack at solving the puzzle. The characters can

also release the elementals individually by putting

titles in the wrong order or orientation.

Puzzle handout 6 (see the end of this chapter)

illustrates the row of tiles set into the wall above

the statues. Without a check, the characters real

ize that four of the tiles fell down when the door

slammed shut behind them. With a successful DC

15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, a character can de

termine that these tiles are what keeps the elemen

tals bound.

If a tile is placed in the wrong place in the row,

the corresponding elemental is freed from its

stone prison and attacks. Only one of each elemen

tal appears:

If the improperly placed tile has an open triangle

pointing downward, the water elemental is freed.

If the improperly placed tile has an open triangle

pointing upward, the fire elemental is freed.

If the improperly placed tile has a triangle point

ing upward with a horizontal line running through

it, the air elemental is freed.

If the improperly placed tile has a triangle point

ing downward with a horizontal line running

through it, the earth elemental is freed.

The odd-numbered tiles form a recurring pat

tern of open triangles that alternate between

pointing up and down. Tiles 1, 5,9, and 13 are

upward-pointing triangles, while tiles 3, 7, and 11

are downward-pointing triangles.

The even-numbered tiles display a different pat

tern. Tiles 2 and 4 point downward, but the first of

them has a line through the triangle. Tiles 6 and 8

follow the same pattern, but the triangles point up.

The pattern then repeats, with tiles 10 and 12 being

the same as tiles 2 and 4 and tile 14 being the same

as tile 6.

Solving the puzzle or defeating all four elementals

causes the door to the room to swing open.

HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability

checks to receive a hint:

Intelligence (Investigation) DC 15. The character

notes the words "even" and "odd" in the verse on

the room's floor and believes they have some sig

nificance to the missing tiles.

Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. The character

can deduce which tiles correspond to which

elementals.

CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

Interweaving multiple patterns makes it easy to

disguise them. With this in mind, you might use any

group of symbols to create as elaborate a series of

patterns as you please, then challenge players to

fill in a missing segment. While the symbols in this

puzzle refer to the four elements, you might use holy

symbols, colors, dolls on a shelf, or any other repeat

ing design to convey your puzzle.

When an elemental is defeated, it might leave be

hind a valuable gemstone, a map fragment, a clue to

some other puzzle, or something similar.

RAISING THE DIFFICULTY

To increase the difficulty of this puzzle, enforce a

time factor: perhaps one elemental breaks free at

the end of every five minutes of real time that pass

until the puzzle is solved.

You can also raise the difficulty by having statues

depict genies instead of elementals. In this case,

replace the four elementals with a dao, a djinni, an

efreeti, and a marid. These genies are compelled to

attack the characters and can't be reasoned with.

with the alcoves in the hall (see "Alcoves" later

in this section). While Dolora can't answer vague

questions about the candles' clues (such as "Who

is this talking about?"), she can provide the names

of specific people when prompted. For example, if

a character asks directly,  "What was your mother's

name?" Dolora provides the correct response. She

also spells out the name, which is a clue that the

spelling is important.

PUZZLE FEATURES

Dolora can't leave the hall and avoids the alcoves.

ALCOVES

The hall is lined with six alcoves, each one with a

unique numeral between 1 and 6 carved above it. A

verse scratched into the back wall of each alcove is

made visible by the candlelight. Each verse is pre

sented below, accompanied by a parenthetical expla

nation that shouldn't be shared with the players or

their characters:

Verse 1. "Not his keeper, nor he mine; loved and

hated at the same time." (This refers to Dolora's

brother, whose name was Sam.)

Verse 2. "My first vision: her hazel eyes. My first

sound: her lullabies." (This refers to Dolora's

mother, whose name was Delia.)

Verse 3. "Her lives she lost, all three by three, and

through the dark this hunter sees." (This refers to

Dolora's cat, whose name was Fifi.)

Verse 4. "Lines in his face of life lived long; stories

were his paternal song." (This refers to Dolora's

grandfather, whose name was Tobias.)

Verse 5. "Mentor and guide, her lessons learned.

Knowledge measured by letters I earned."

(This refers to Dolora's teacher, whose name

was Johana.)

Verse 6. "Loved to eat hay, just as her friends did;

lived in one room with a shoat and a kid." (This re

fers to Dolora's horse, whose name was Alexia.)

Each verse describes someone who was close to

Dolora. Once the characters determine who a verse

is talking about, they may ask Dolora to provide

the correct name. For example, "What is your cat's

name?" is a valid question for verse 3. The spirit

then answers, "Fifi," and she spells it aloud.

CANDLES

Each candle is a simple, 6-inch-tall wax taper. While

in this hall, the candles never melt down and can't

be extinguished.

RAG DOLL

If the characters examine the rag doll or ask Dolora

about it, she imparts the following information:

HAUNTED HALLWAY

Difficulty: Hard

Many unquiet spirits linger in the world because

they can't bare to leave something behind. In this

puzzle, finding the solution also means helping a

lost soul find peace.

Six alcoves line this hall, each one numbered from one

to six. On the floor of each alcove, a lit candle gen

tly flickers.

From the hall's far end drifts a low moan. There,

barely visible, sobs the apparition of a small girl hov

ering over a discarded rag doll. "Names, names,"

she cries. "I can remember them all  except the

one I  need."

The spirit, Dolora, is a harmless apparition who

won't engage the party in combat. If threatened, she

vanishes and reappears at the opposite end of the

hall, sobbing anew.

If approached with compassion, Dolora bemoans

the fact that she can't pick up her doll until she

speaks its name, which she has forgotten. She re

fuses to leave this place without the doll.

Dolora, who only recalls fragmented memories

of her life, can't answer many questions. This is

particularly true about the messages associated

CHAPTER 4 I  DUNGEON  MASTER'S TOOLS

"My doll knows all  six--the first for the first, the sec

ond for the second, the third for the third, the fourth

for the fourth, the fifth for the fifth, and the sixth for

the sixth."

SOLUTION

Once the characters learn all six names, they must

extract one letter from each name, as noted in the

Remembered Names table. An alcove's number

determines which letter to extract; for example,

"Alexia" is the name connected to the verse in al

cove 6, and the sixth letter in that name is A.

The doll's name is Sefina. Once Dolora is told this,

she picks up the doll, speaks its name, and disap

pears with it, her spirit having been laid to rest. If

there's some piece of information you wish to have

the spirit reveal to the party, such as the location of

a nearby treasure or the secret of a more dangerous

spirit, Dolora whispers this as she fades away.

HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability

checks to receive a hint:

Charisma (Persuasion) DC 10. Dolora thinks of

the character as her friend. When this character

figures out the answer to a riddle, Dolora calls out

the name of the person it's about unprompted (for

example, as soon as the character says "mother"

aloud, Dolora calls out "Delia").

Charisma (Intimidation) DC 15. The character

frightens Dolora into divulging information. She

tells the character that she remembers the names

of people she knew. Dolora also reveals that it's

important that their names be spelled correctly,

though she doesn't say why.

Intelligence (Investigation) DC 15. The character

interprets Dolora's cryptic clue about the doll as

follows: "all six" refers to the six letters of the

doll's name, which can be determined by gather

ing information from the verses in the six alcoves.

WHAT'S ON THE MENU

Difficulty: Hard

The characters discover that a popular local tavern

is a front for a secret organization that they seek

to join or infiltrate. The name of the tavern can be

whatever you want it to be. One suggestion is the

Cloak & Dagger.

To get their foot in the proverbial door, the char

acters must speak the correct password to the

tavern-keeper, Holda Heidrun. They can discover

this password by solving a puzzle hidden in the

tavern's menu.

The tavern is crowded with happy people enjoying

their food and drinks. Behind the bar, a stocky woman

is wiping down the wooden bar top. She looks up as

you enter and nods toward an empty table before her

attention is drawn elsewhere. You see a copy of the

tavern's menu on the table.

Customize the tavern and flesh out its occupants as

you see fit.

In addition to being the tavern-keeper, Holda

Heidrun is the keeper of many secrets. If the char

acters prod her for information, she asks for the

password, and if the characters don't know it, she

divulges nothing of consequence. "If you're worth

your weight in copper," she says, "you'd speak the

password to earn my trust."

PUZZLE FEATURES

A sign at the bar declares that a meal costs 1 sp, a

mug of ale costs 4 cp, a glass of fine wine costs 1

sp, and a bottle of fine wine costs 3 sp. The menu

on the table contains a list of specialties the tavern

serves, and how much each item costs. Only the

menu is needed to solve the puzzle.

Dexterity (Stealth) DC 15. The character blends

in with the crowd to eavesdrop on another table,

overhearing the patrons discussing how they must

Intelligence (History) DC 15. The character recalls

stories of how secret messages used to be sent

could access, such as menus.

Wisdom (Perception) DC 15. The character notices

the prices on the menu don't make much sense.

For example, why is rabbit stew so much cheaper

than corn and lentil stew?

CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

"Chimera" might not be the password but rather

a reference to something or someone else in the

tavern. Characters who solve the puzzle and suc

ceed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check might

notice another patron wearing a cloak pin shaped

like a chimera, or spot a shield emblazoned with a

chimera hanging on a wall that conceals a secret

door. Only after speaking to the patron or seeing

what's on the other side of the secret door do the

characters obtain the actual password, which can

be anything you want.

You can easily change "chimera" to something

else by swapping out menu items, choosing different

letters within the replacement items, and adjusting

the prices accordingly.

LOWERING THE DIFFICULTY

Other tavern patrons can provide additional hints

by talking among themselves in places where the

characters can overhear them. A patron might say

something like, "This inn keeps getting more expen

sive. With these fancy new meals, I'm surprised they

aren't charging a copper per letter!"

A too-helpful barmaid might take pity on the strug

gling characters and walk them through the various

menu items in the order that would allow them to

skip the anagram (ale and cheese pastry, brandied

ham and carrots, corn and lentil soup, dragonfire

mead, grilled fish and carrots, rabbit stew, and

seared boar and potatoes). She might even recom

mend that the characters "start with the ale and

cheese pastry,  and continue on from there."

SOLUTION

Arrange the menu items in alphabetical order, then

count into each item by the number of letters indi

cated in its price, as shown in the What's On the

Menu Solution table. Stringing the seven letters

together forms the password: chimera.

WHAT'S ON THE MENU SOLUTION

Item (Price)

Letter

Ale and cheese pastry (7 cp)

C (7th letter)

Brandied ham and carrots (9 cp)

Corn and lentil  soup (12 cp)

Dragonfire mead (11  cp)

Grilled fish and carrots (6 cp)

Rabbit stew (1  cp)

H (9th letter)

I  (12th letter)

M  (llth letter)

E (6th letter)

R  (1st letter)

Seared boar and potatoes (3 cp)

A (3rd letter)

The characters can figure out the password with

out putting the menu items in alphabetical order.

Once they get all seven letters, they must solve the

anagram to get the password.

Speaking the correct password to Holda grants

access to whatever secrets she's keeping-fuel for

the characters' next adventure.
